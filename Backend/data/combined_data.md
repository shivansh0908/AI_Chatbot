## Content
### Nuclear Structure Physics The Nuclear Physics group has multiple research endeavours in fundamental physics, including the study of metastable states, superheavy nuclei and nuclear shapes. In addition, various societal applications like the exploration of energy sources and the study of elemental and isotopic composition of materials are also being pursued. The primary focus of the Nuclear Physics group is on the understanding of the structure of many-body, strongly-interacting atomic nuclei. This encompasses, but is not limited to, elements with the highest atomic numbers in the periodic chart, the study of metastable states (nuclear isomers) in the vicinity of the heaviest doubly-magic nucleus, 208Pb, and higher-order deformations in the radium-thorium region. The excited level structure of nuclei is inferred from multi-fold gamma-ray coincidence measurements using large arrays of high-purity germanium detectors. Different excitation mechanisms, ranging from purely intrinsic to highly collective, are studied to obtain an understanding of the strong nuclear interaction. The development of measurement techniques for basic and applied research using a variety of nuclear radiation detectors, and in particular digital signal processing, is also being done. This is coupled with new approaches for multi-parameter data reduction and analysis of nuclear spectroscopic data. Societal applications of nuclear measurement techniques are also being implemented. Two noteworthy areas are the exploration of nuclear energy sources across India through gamma-ray spectroscopy, and the identification of hazardous materials in consumer products through x-ray fluorescence studies. Experiments are performed in-house and at premier particle-accelerator based facilities across India, the US and Europe. State-of-the-art radiation detection systems are used for the data acquisition and the offline data reduction and analysis is performed inhouse with programs specifically designed for this purpose.

![](images/picture13.1600x0.webp) # Sample Processing Laboratory When research samples are synthesized by physical or chemical methods, they generally contain various kinds of internal as well as surface defects. These intrinsic defects influence the fundamental properties of samples. High temperature thermal annealing in air or vacuum help to remove all these defects. Thermal treatments can be done at 30-1000oC under vacuum in the range of 760 torr to 10-7 torr. Thermal treatments can also be done under various flowing gases. **Location** Ground Floor, Room: R018

### Plant Biotechnology, Climate Change and Sustainability Our collective research endeavors focus on understanding and mitigating the impacts of environmental change across diverse biological systems. From the intricate molecular mechanisms that enable plants to withstand drought and salinity, to the neural circuits guiding insect pollinators, the microbial communities degrading pollutants, and the cellular pathways maintaining protein homeostasis under extreme conditions, our work explores the fundamental principles of adaptation and resilience. We investigate the genetic and ecological foundations of biodiversity, examining how organisms from aquatic ecosystems to wetlands and terrestrial environments respond to stressors like climate change, pollution, and habitat loss. Employing a wide range of cutting-edge techniques, including high-throughput sequencing, advanced bioinformatics, statistical modeling and game theory, metagenomics and synthetic biology, conservation genetics, neuroethology, microbial genomics, and plant biotechnology, we seek to unravel the complex interactions between organisms and their environments. We aim to translate our fundamental discoveries into practical solutions for sustainable agriculture, conservation, and bioremediation. By understanding the molecular basis of plant stress tolerance, we strive to enhance crop resilience and ensure food security. By studying the genetics and ecology of aquatic species, we contribute to the conservation of vital ecosystems. By elucidating the neurobiology of insect pollinators, we safeguard essential ecological services. And by harnessing the power of microbial communities, we develop innovative strategies for environmental cleanup. Ultimately, our research is driven by a shared commitment to understanding the biological responses to global change and developing strategies that promote ecological sustainability and human well-being. We recognize that the challenges facing our planet are interconnected and that a holistic, interdisciplinary approach is essential for finding lasting solutions. ![Dr. Neelesh Dahanukar](images/artboard_1.jpg) **Dr. Neelesh Dahanukar** Assistant Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1a747f7f767f6972347e7b727b746f717b685a69746f347f7e6f347374) **Research focus** * Conservation genetics and genomics for understanding the molecular ecology of threatened species and their conservation needs. * Population dynamics and exploitation analysis for conservation management and action. * Evolutionary game theory and conflict resolution among various stakeholders. ![Dr. Koyeli Mapa](images/artboard_1_copy.jpg) **Dr. Koyeli Mapa** Associate Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#543f3b2d31383d7a3935243514273a217a3130217a3d3a) **Research focus** * Proteotoxic stresses due to several altered environmental conditions like extreme heat stress, chemical stresses, or DNA-damaging stresses. * Modulation of cellular response by endoplasmic reticulum-unfolded protein response pathway. ![Dr. Richa Priyadarshini](images/artboard_1_copy_2.jpg) **Dr. Richa Priyadarshini** Associate Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#27554e444f460957554e5e46434655544f4e494e6754495209424352094e49) **Research focus** * Whole genome sequencing of Novel Bacteria. * Harnessing biotechnological applications of novel bacterial isolates. * Studying the role of microbes in plastic degradation. ![Dr. Rohini Garg](images/artboard_1_copy_3.jpg) **Dr. Rohini Garg** Associate Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2809d9a9b9c9bdc95938095b2819c87dc979687dc9b9c) **Research focus** * Epigenomic regulation of abiotic stress response in chickpea. * Gene regulation under abiotic stress response in chickpea. * Small peptide-mediated stress tolerance in chickpeas and Arabidopsis. * Genome and epigenome editing of regulatory regions in Arabidopsis and chickpea. ![Dr. Tanvi Deora](images/artboard_1_copy_4.jpg) **Dr. Tanvi Deora** Faculty Fellow Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7c081d120a15521819130e1d3c0f120952191809521512) **Research focus** * **Sensory Ecology:** We study the insect nervous system to understand how sensing and learning affect plant pollination. * **Climate change and Anthropogenic Impact on Pollination:** We study the pollination networks in the field to ask how various environmental factors such as light pollution, and decreasing flower diversity impact the pollination networks of diurnal and nocturnal insects. **Stress Survival: The Plant's Molecular Toolkit** **Dr. Rohini Garg** ![](images/picture1y.1091x0-is-pid20122.png) *Plants are subjected to a variety of abiotic stresses like cold, heat, drought, and salinity. We study molecular responses to abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis and chickpea, focusing on DNA methylation, lncRNAs, DNA secondary structures, and small peptides. Our goal is to identify target genes for enhancing plant stress tolerance.* Plants face constant threats from environmental stresses like drought and salinity. We study the molecular regulation of abiotic stress tolerance in plants, focusing on chickpea and Arabidopsis responses to drought and salinity. Our research delves into the roles of DNA methylation, DNA secondary structures, long non-coding RNAs, and small peptides in modulating gene expression under stress. We utilize high-throughput sequencing (e.g., RNA-seq, ChIP-seq), advanced bioinformatics analyses, and biotechnological approaches like gene editing and overexpression to decipher these complex regulatory networks. By integrating cutting-edge sequencing technologies with sophisticated bioinformatics and targeted genetic manipulation, we aim to understand the fundamental principles of plant adaptation and translate this knowledge into improved crop varieties. Ultimately, we seek to identify and manipulate specific genes to enhance crop resilience in challenging environments. **Lab homepage:** <https://snu.edu.in/faculty/rohini-garg/> **Relevant publications:** 1.

We employ a variety of research methods including conservation genetics, high throughput genomics analysis, statistical inferences, and mathematical modelling to understand the conservation needs for marine and freshwater fishes (primary interest) and other vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. Work on conservation genetic and genomics include population genetics analysis for understanding genetic heterogeneity, dispersal and fragmentation, historical population changes, genome wide selection patterns and molecular systematics to understand conservation needs for various threatened taxa. We also employ statistical methods to understand the sustainability of exploited fisheries of threatened species, both marine and freshwaters, to understand the future of natural stocks and propose conservation action and management plans. We use game theoretical analysis to understand how to resolve conflict among various stakeholders for ensuring conservation of natural resources. **Laboratory homepage**: <https://sites.google.com/snu.edu.in/molecoevo> **Relevant publications:** 1.

We also study how the natural history and ecology of an animal shape’s its neural system and behavior.* From the tiny jellyfish in the sea to large birds in the sky, nervous systems of animals shape their interactions with their environment. In our lab, we study how insects' nervous systems help them interact with flowers during pollination. Insects are the major pollinators of flowering plants and how they find and feed from flowers have a huge impact on their role as pollinators. Several sensory cues such as vision, olfaction, hygrosensation (humidity), touch etc. shape these crucial interactions. In the lab we study how sensory systems of insects like butterflies and moths guide locomotion to enable tasks that demand expert control such as targeting a tiny nectary opening in the flower to drink nectar while also hovering and hence pollinating the flowers. We study the impact of sensing and learning on feeding and pollination efficiency to reveal sensorimotor mechanisms underlying pollination interactions. Combining comparative studies in the lab and field, we hope to understand how natural history of animals have shaped their nervous systems and their ecological interactions. Importantly, these studies will help us understand how declining floral and insect biodiversity or increasing anthropogenic pollutants such as artificial light at night impact ecological services like insect pollination. **Laboratory homepage**: <https://sites.google.com/view/tanvideora/home> **Relevant publications:** 1. **Deora T**, Ahmed MA, Daniel TL, Brunton BW.

RSC Adv. 2018 Nov 8;8(66):37590-37599. doi: 10.1039/c8ra06448b.* Wetlands, defined as land areas that are saturated with water – either permanently or seasonally – are rich ecosystems supporting a wide array of flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity of wetlands has attracted attention due to the high number of species present in the small geographical area. Bacterial diversity in wetland ecosystems is estimated to be an amalgamation between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Metagenomics and synthetic biology advancements have paved the way for utilizing microbial diversity for tailored applications. Harnessing microbial biodiversity supports sustainable development by reducing environmental impact and promoting circular bioeconomy principles. One of the primary goals of our research is to isolate and characterize microbes with biotechnological potential from wetlands. Biodegradation is a process by which microbial organisms that transform or degrade chemicals introduced into the environment. Our laboratory has isolated two bacterial strains from Dadri wetlands, *Exiguobacterium sibiricum* strain DR11*, Exiguobacterium undae* strain DR14, with potential degrade plastic, especially polystyrene. These bacterial strains establish biofilms on plastic material and secrete enzymes probably initiating the process of depolymerisation. Growth studies suggested that these *Exiguobacterium* strains can utilize polystyrene as a carbon source. Further characterization of these bacteria would provide insight into the enzymes and pathways used in plastic biodegradation. **Lab homepage:** <https://snu.edu.in/faculty/richa-priyadarshini/> **Relevant Publications:** 1.

# Computational Study of Adsorption of Magnesium Polysulfides on (VS4) Magnesium Sulfur Batteries (DOI:10.1016/j.matpr.2022.11.399) | School of Natural Sciences

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-natural-sciences/research/computational-study-of-adsorption-of-magnesium-polysulfides-on-vs4-magnesium-sulfur-batteries-doi-10.1016-j.matpr.2022.11.399/

## Content
Research Project ### Computational Study of Adsorption of Magnesium Polysulfides on (VS4) Magnesium Sulfur Batteries (DOI:10.1016/j.matpr.2022.11.399) New high-performance battery designs need to be developed to feed the growing needs of electrostatic energy storage. Magnesium-Sulphur (Mg-S) batter- ies are fast emerging as a promising candidate in the last few years. However, they are plagued by viability issues due to the ‘Shuttle Effect’ slowing down the reaction kinetic and causing rapid decay of battery capacity. The shuttle effect is due to the formation of meta-stable Mg polysulphides (*MgSx*) that are soluble in the battery electrolyte. The formation of these polysulphides reduce the efficiency of the cell reaction, and cause a loss of electrode material since the ploysulfides cannot be recycled. To combat these issues, vanadium tetrasulphide (*VS*4) has been identified as a potential adsorbent for the *MgSx*, which can help recycle them and act as a catalyst. In this project, the adsorption capacity of the [110] surface of *VS*4 towards various *MgSx* has been computationally investigated by performing ab initio Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The adsorption energies of various *MgSx* upon adsorption on (*VS*4) have been calculated using this method. The results are promising, the adsorption energies of (*MgSx*) is in range of (*−*1*.*40 *→ −*0*.*14) (*eV/atom*) with the highest and lowest adsorption energies in case of MgS and *MgS*8 respectively. The adsorbate and adsorbent structure is not substantially altered by adsorption, which is crucial to eliminate capacity fading and promote battery life cycle. There could be seen a significant amount of charge transfer from (*MgSx*) to *VS*4 thus suggesting good performance of *VS*4 in mitigating the shuttle effect in magnesium sulfur batteries.The electronic properties discloses that all the adsorbed system possess indirect band gaps. We believe that the thorough investigation presented in this work offers a practical theory for creating a suitable separator that in- corporates *VS*4 , which can promote good cycle and material usage in Mg-S batteries.

# Translation in Praxis

## Content
# Translation in Praxis ![](images/dr_sumeet_pal_banner_for_blog-05_1_1600x0_1.1600x0.webp) Editorial / September 19, 2025 Two of the past five winners of the International Booker Prize, including this year’s, have been books by Indian authors in English translation: Banu Mushtaq’s Kannada short story collection translated by Deepa Bhasthi as *Heart Lamp* and Geetanjali Shree’s Hindi novel translated by Daisy Rockwell as *Tomb of Sand*. Such heartening news attests to the fact that there is an emerging market for contemporary Indian literature in translation. Poetry, however, features far less than literary fiction in this market. Recognising Indian poetry’s potential to enthuse a global audience, *The Antonym Collections* (a publishing house dedicated entirely to translated literature) launched a poetry translation residency in August 2023. ![](images/bookcover.245x0-is-pid21198.jpg) Focusing on four lesser-known Bengali poets who they believed deserve a wider audience for their oeuvre, Antonym released a call for translators, to which Dr. Sreejata Paul, Assistant Professor of English at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR, applied. Winning the Indrani Mukherjee Memorial Scholarship and being paired with the poet Ramchandra Pramanik, Dr. Paul then embarked on a two-year journey to translate a book-length volume of selections from his poetry published between the 1970s and the 2020s. The said volume, titled *The Opposite Bank and Other Poems*, was finally released on 4th September 2025. At the launch event in the Shiv Nadar University campus, Dr. Paul explained how “in music theory, a harmony stacks notes above and below the root note to add texture and depth to the melody. Translation works in much the same way.. I hope that I’ve been able to conjure other aural contexts and lifeworlds for [Pramanik’s] poems to circulate in.” She also spoke about the challenges of translating the work of a living author and those of translating poetry, especially in terms of rendering internal rhymes, run-on lines and culturally specific onomatopoeia. Translation has, in different ways, been crucial to Dr. Paul’s literary critical scholarship since her doctoral research. Her Ph.D. dissertation, for instance, centralised the work of Muslim women writers from colonial Bengal, which she unearthed from archives in Kolkata, Dhaka and London and then went on to digitise, as well as translate. The slow and rigorous process of translation allowed her to examine the influence of Perso-Arabic vocabulary and literary forms on these women’s writing. In her more recent research on the intersections between gender and non-human beings, Dr. Paul explores how the humanities and social sciences can provide translational paradigms to foster understanding, mutual respect, and collaborative meaning-making across species lines. Dr Paul’s research and writing largely revolve around women’s intellectual networks, Islam in South Asia, and environmental and plant humanities. She has been translating literary and critical work from Bengali into English from 2017 onwards and is currently thinking through what words one leaves untranslated and the role of gender in translation.

Raja Mohan**, Senior Fellow, Asia Society Policy Institute, Delhi on **17 March**, from **12:00PM to 1:30PM.** The Russian war in Ukraine, widely seen as a hinge moment in global politics, is also a turning point in the region’s relations with the United States, Europe, Russia and China. The war is testing the traditional meaning of ‘strategic autonomy’ in India and the future of Pakistan’s alliances with the US and China. The developments in Ukraine also raise questions about India’s claims for a “sphere of influence” in the Subcontinent and the management of relations between a dominant power and its weaker neighbours. Prof C. Raja Mohan is a Senior Fellow with the Asia Society Policy Institute in Delhi--a division of the Asia Society India Centre, Mumbai. He is a Visiting Research Professor at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS), National University of Singapore and was previously the Director of ISAS. Prof. Mohan was the founding director of Carnegie India in Delhi, the sixth international center of Carnegie Endowment for Peace. He was associated with several Indian think tanks, including the Institute of Defense Studies and Analyses. He was a Professor of South Asian Studies at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and the Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore, and also served on India’s National Security Advisory Board. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-life-sciences-conducted-a-seminar-on-hypoxia-mediated-epigenetic-regulation-of-cancer-cell-metabolism/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-physical-education-is-organizing-the-yoga-nidra-deep-meditation-program/)

## Faculty at School of Humanities and Social Sciences ![Vikram Kapur](images/vikram_kapur.1600x0.webp) # Vikram Kapur Professor & Head School of Humanities and Social Sciences ##### Contact Information * Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6f1906041d0e0241040e1f1a1d2f1c011a410a0b1a410601) * Number: [275](tel:275) ## Research Interest My principal focus is creative writing (fiction and nonfiction). I have published three critically-acclaimed novels, *Time Is a Fire*, *The Wages of Life* and *The Assassinations*, as well as edited a well-known anthology of writing on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots entitled *1984: In Memory and* *Imagination*. In addition, I have published several short stories and pieces of nonfiction in publications in the United Kingdom, United States and India. These include, among others, *World Literature Today, The Los Angeles Review of Books, The Mekong Review, Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine, The Hong Kong Review, Litro, Ambit, the Dublin Quarterly, New Writing, Driftwood, The Hindu, Frontline* and *Firstpost*. A full list of publications is available on my website www.vikramkapur.com. My short fiction has been shortlisted or longlisted in a number of major international competitions including, among others, the Commonwealth Short Story Prize (UK), the Fish International Short Story Prize (Ireland) and the Radiobooks Short Story Prize (Radio Netherlands World Service). I have received several prestigious scholarships and fellowships including, among others, the Vermont Studio Center fellowship (USA), the Canserrat Arts Center residency (Spain), the India-Africa bursary from the University of East Anglia (UK) and the Wesleyan scholarship (U.S.A.). I have been Visiting Writer or Writer-in-Residence at a number of universities including, most recently, IIT Madras, Asian College of Journalism and the University of Heidelberg in Germany. My experience has taught me that it is important to read as a writer and write as a reader. The creative and the critical are not mutually exclusive. Rather, they are complementary. It is not possible to excel in one while ignoring the other, which is the key lesson I wish to pass on to my students. In addition to creative writing, I also have interests in Crime Writing and Literature about the Two World Wars. ## Education * PhD in creative and critical writing, School of Literature and Creative Writing, University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom, October 2004-July 2010. * Master of Mass Communication, University of Georgia, Athens, Ga, United States, March 1992 - June 1994. * Bachelor of Arts in English Literature, Armstrong State College (now Armstrong Atlantic State University), Savannah, Ga, United States, September 1988 – August 1991. * Freshman year, Millsaps College, Jackson, Ms, United States, August 1987 – May 1988.

Studies in the last decade have revealed the resounding similarity between Drosophila and vertebrate blood cell development or hematopoiesis. Employing this invertebrate model, we have discovered several signaling networks essential for stem cells, blood progenitor and their niche interactions. Our group has made seminal contributions towards understanding stem cells and niche biology in the last ten years. We have demonstrated hematopoietic stem cells in larvae and active sites for hematopoietic activity in the adult Drosophila (Developmental Cell, 2015; eLife, 2016). In the process of uncovering the new molecular basis of hematopoietic processes, our group revealed that the origin, maturation, expansion, and homing of precursors are conserved between the fly and vertebrates. Employing molecular genetic approaches, we have illustrated that the stem cell niche can gauge an animal's physiological state before instructing the stem cells (Development, 2019). We have unraveled how metabolic cues and intrinsic signaling facilitate blood progenitor differentiation (eLife, 2020). We have recently tried to understand how the ongoing hematopoiesis can be jacked up to emergency mode during infection. This transition is essential to generate lots of White Blood cells (WBC) to fight infection. Our understanding of the molecular players essential for this switch to emergency hematopoiesis is far from complete. Since the blood development in fruit flies has considerable similarities with mammals, we have used this model to understand how this transition to emergency mode is achieved during infection. These results and other findings from our laboratory will be discussed. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/school-of-management-entrepreneurship-organizing-a-seminar-on-self-employment-and-psychological-well-being/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-life-sciences-conducted-a-seminar-on-hypoxia-mediated-epigenetic-regulation-of-cancer-cell-metabolism/)

The session will be moderated by **Dr. Jagabandhu Dixit,** Assistant Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR. A disaster, such as a flood, earthquake, or landslide, spreads through a geographical domain with varied severity and duration from its single/multiple source places. Natural elements (rivers, floodplains, marshes, and forest for flood disasters) and man-made facilities occupy the majority of the geographical space (reservoirs, embankment, high-rise houses, culverts, drainage network). Natural features change over longer time scales, such as the carrying capacity of rivers. Man-made disaster-reduction infrastructures, on the other hand, must not only gain socioeconomic acceptance, but also change their effectiveness over time (ageing effect of a dam and embankment). We may utilize the spatial data mining concept on historical events to learn about disasters; source, propagation, and subsequent damages by considering their spatial and temporal variations. In spatial data mining, spatial hotspots and their temporal evaluation for disasters can be efficiently mapped in a global geographical cloud dataset combined with locally gathered data from field sensors and people disaster resilience. Note that, new advanced techniques such as spatial auto-correlation and natural spatial clustering schemes can be used in plot-scale disaster vulnerability mapping, which is essential for disaster preparedness and near-real-time rescue operations. The prediction of a disaster with a lead time of a few minutes, hours, or days is now possible by spatial data mining on geographical cloud data storage and modern deep learning techniques. In this presentation, a few flood case studies for Indian river basins will be presented. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-life-sciences-organizes-seminar-on-multiscale-modeling-of-human-disease-biology-from-molecules-to-patients/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-physical-education-is-organizing-the-inter-department-badminton-championship-2022/)

# Unlocking the Secrets of Metastable States in Atomic Nuclei

# Unlocking the Secrets of Metastable States in Atomic Nuclei ![](images/b_1.1600x0.webp) Editorial / September 30, 2025 In the complex world of nuclear physics, where matter is probed at its most fundamental level, Prof. Sujit Tandel, Senior Professor at the School of Natural Sciences, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, has been steadily working to advance our understanding of some of the most intriguing states of matter—metastable states in atomic nuclei. These long-lived excited states, also known as nuclear isomers, are not only windows into the mechanics of what goes on inside an atom’s nucleus, but also hold immense promise for real-world applications, from medical imaging to futuristic batteries and clocks. At the heart of his research lies one of nature’s most enigmatic interactions: the strong nuclear force. This fundamental force binds protons and neutrons together inside every nucleus, yet remains inadequately understood. An ‘excited’ nucleus has more energy than its stable ‘ground state’. The excess energy makes it unstable, and it releases the energy quickly to return to the stable ground state. However, this is not always a super quick phenomenon. Prof. Tandel explains, “*Strong nuclear interactions are not well understood. Most excited nuclear states exist for a trillionth of a second, but these long-lived states can exist for as long as seconds, minutes, or in rare cases, even years*.” This endurance of metastable states allows researchers to observe and harness them in ways unfeasible with shorter-lived states—something that has always interested Prof. Tandel. By examining the peculiar lifetimes and decay modes of isomers, Prof. Tandel and his team extract rare insights into these quantum wave functions. Unpacking these patterns has even led his group to discover ‘extreme isomers’: states with exceptionally high excitation energies, angular momentum, or lifetimes that stand apart from all others. Another one of Prof. Tandel’s research areas is nuclear isomers in superheavy elements (elements in the periodic table well beyond Uranium, with atomic numbers 92 and above), which are synthesized in laboratories and extend the periodic table to atomic number 118. He recalls a striking ‘Eureka!’ moment: while working on isotopes of Nobelium, a superheavy element (atomic number 102), he realised that studying the properties of these long-lived states could help predict which superheavy elements might be less difficult to produce and identify in the lab. That insight opened a new frontier, with dozens of global studies building upon this, shaping how researchers explore the boundaries of the periodic table and superheavy elements. However, such breakthroughs do not come easily. One of the biggest challenges is bringing together expertise, equipment, and manpower for the successful execution of experiments. The complex experiments demand state-of-the-art radiation detectors, cutting-edge instrumentation, advanced measurement techniques and signal processing, as well as years of painstaking preparation. “*It is like picking a needle out of a haystack*,” Prof. Tandel says, reflecting on the challenges of isolating the information they want from large volumes of data. He further notes that while nuclear physicists have developed a fair understanding of stable nuclei and those lacking neutrons, neutron-rich nuclei remain difficult to produce and study. These nuclei hold answers to many questions, including how the heaviest elements in the universe are formed. They are created through rapid neutron capture processes in stellar environments (such as stars like our sun), but replicating and investigating that in the lab remains a challenge. “*Filling this gap and uncovering the structure and behaviour of neutron-rich nuclei is central to advancing both fundamental physics and our understanding of heavy elements in the cosmos*”, explains Prof. Tandel. Today, nuclear isomers already play important roles in medicine and could enable powerful new technologies in the near future. Technetium-99m, for example, is an isomer used in millions of medical imaging procedures worldwide each year. A future prospect is the nuclear clock, which promises extremely high-precision tracking in applications where minuscule-level timekeeping is required. Another ambitious vision is the nuclear battery, which can harness the immense energy stored in nuclear isomers—often millions of times more than chemical reactions—to pack unprecedented power into small volumes. For Prof. Tandel, research and mentorship go hand in hand. His message to aspiring nuclear physicists is both candid and practical: “*This is a challenging field and it is intellectually stimulating and satisfying. But the transferable skills and discipline you develop, from physics to instrumentation and electronics to computer programming, will serve you wherever you go.”* He adds that global investment in nuclear physics will continue as countries seek to meet energy demands and advance technologies, ensuring opportunities in both research and applied domains. “*There is a lot happening in this field, and it addresses one of the most basic requirements of the human race: energy, with the practically limitless and clean nuclear fusion energy on the horizon*.” He also explains how today’s nuclear research could inspire tomorrow’s transformative technologies. A shining example is Rudolf Mössbauer, whose work in nuclear physics at a young age led to the discovery of the Mössbauer effect, creating an entirely new research area, now widely used in physics, chemistry, and biology. As he looks ahead, Prof. Tandel remains energised by the mysteries yet unsolved, gaps currently unaddressed, and the applications waiting to be realised. His work stands at the crossroads of fundamental physics and societal impact, pushing the boundaries of existing knowledge while opening doors to future innovation. We look forward to his next discovery and the real-life innovations that it may bring!

How to generalize the Thermodynamics we learn in our undergraduate studies, to small systems remains a deep problem, but with very little practical applications. The situation changed over the last three decades when it became necessary to understand the molecular machines that play a crucial role in Biology. This gave rise to the field of "Stochastic Thermodynamics". After giving a broad but brief introduction to this topic, I will describe how we use ideas borrowed from Stochastic Thermodynamics to calculate the fundamental non-equilibrium nature of the fluctuations of cell membranes. **About the Speaker**: Dhrubaditya Mitra obtained his PhD from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore working on Spatiotemporal Multiscaling in Turbulence. He held Postdoctoral positions at the Nice Observatory in France and the Queen Mary University of London. He has been at NORDITA, Stockholm, since 2010. He has worked on a wide variety of problems from length scales of micrometer (Cells) to mega meters (the Sun).

Thermonuclear explosions, such as Type Ia supernovae, Novae and X-ray bursts allow to probe details of the astrophysical scenarios through detailed modeling – if the nuclear reaction rates are known. Key reactions determine the ignition point, the energy generation and the abundances of elements created. While some progress has been made, many key reactions involving radioactive isotopes are still unknown at the required energies. Even with the next generation of rare-isotope facilities, such as FRIB, these experiments will remain challenging. I will present examples of experiments and methods developed to overcome the particular difficulties, such as the ANASEN active-target detector, which has been used successfully at the John D. Fox Laboratory of Florida State University as well as TRIUMF in Canada and Michigan State University. In addition to these pioneering efforts, FSU has re-established the high-resolution Super-Enge Split Pole Spectrograph, or the Clarion-2 Gamma-spectroscopy array, which now allow to add indirect information aiding in the nuclear astrophysics research. FSU is a founding member of ARUNA, the Association for Research at University Nuclear Accelerators, which makes the case that extending the diversity of instruments and probes is vital to the health of the field of Nuclear Physics, in the USA and everywhere. All are cordially invited. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/the-mystery-of-the-invisible-universe-a-window-to-new-physics/geopolitics-on-the-map-insights-into-military-dynamics-along-the-lac-through-geospatial-intelligence/) [Next Article](/events/the-mystery-of-the-invisible-universe-a-window-to-new-physics/electrostatic-heteroaggregation-in-colloidal-systems-fundamentals-and-applications/)

My upcoming monograph, *Model Women of the Press*: *Gender, Politics, and Women’s Professional Journalism* (Routledge, New York), offers the first extended account of the mid-century rise of ‘model women of the press’: women who not only stormed the male bastions of social and political journalism but also presented themselves as upholders of the highest standards of professional journalistic practice. From Victorian feminists to female mainstream political journalists, from female foreign and war correspondence to even fictional presswomen, all contributed in distinctive ways to the rise of the Victorian female journalist as a serious, high-minded, and professional author. A new project on imperial periodicals was awarded a Curran Fellowship by the Research Society for Victorian Periodicals (RSVP) My articles on Victorian women’s foreign correspondence, feminist journalism, and celebrity culture have appeared in *Victorian Periodicals Review*, *Women’s Writing* and *Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies*. A book chapter on the campaign for Victorian women’s entry into medicine was published in *Women, Periodicals and Print Culture in Britain, 1830s–1900s* (Edinburgh University Press) and another chapter on mid-century feminist fiction is forthcoming in the *Routledge Companion to Literature and Feminism*. ## Education * BA (Honours) in English.

The workshop is driven by Global Policy Insights (GPI), and will focus on game-theory principles to answer some of the most complex issues around climate change management and global commons. It will also explore the foundation principles in economics and law that form the basis of policy action in the realm of climate governance. Those attending the workshop will also receive certificates on completion of the workshop. **Session 1:** ‘**Climate Governance: Policy Paradigms to Strengthen SDG13 (Climate Action)**’ is a 1hour 30 minutes workshop that covers some of the foundational principles that form the bedrock of policy and legislation to curb air and water pollution. It delves into the logic and philosophical underpinnings of climate change policy to offer an inside view into the mental models of tackling some of the most intractable problems facing the planet today. The workshop also discusses laws and fundamental legal thinking around climate change policy. Eeshan Chaturvedi is the founder of EnviPol and the assistant dean at Jindal School of Environment and Sustainability. He is an environmental and energy lawyer and had completed his LL.M. in environmental law and policy from Stanford Law School in June 2015.

After this, he became the first judicial clerk appointed by the National Green Tribunal. With a specific interest in environmental litigation and policy, he worked on environmental issues ranging from groundwater restoration, restructuring of highways and other infrastructure projects, to sustainable development requirements in policy framework, international oil spill and like cases. **Session 2:** ‘**Game Theory and Systems Thinking for Global Commons**’ is a 1 hour 30 minutes workshop that delves into the problem of collective action through a game theoretical lens. The aim of this workshop is to give handy tools to future policymakers to help them bring about cooperation towards climate change policies. This workshop delves into the various strategies policymakers can adopt to bring about effective action to address climate change and manage global commons. The workshop also utilizes paradigms of systems thinking to understand unintended consequences of various policies, and to spark new and innovative ideas to manage public goods more effectively. Arpit Chaturvedi is the co-founder and CEO of Global Policy Insights. He is also a lecturer at the San Francisco State University where he teaches comparative perspectives in public service to graduate students. A graduate of the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs, Arpit holds an MPA degree with a focus on governance, politics and policy studies.

Stochastic expression manifests as cell-to-cell variability in the levels of RNAs/proteins, even though cells are genetically identical and are exposed to the same environment. The development of computationally tractable frameworks for modeling stochastic fluctuations in gene product levels is essential to understanding how noise at the cellular level affects biological function and phenotype. I will introduce state-of-the-art computational tools for stochastic modeling, analysis, and inferences of biomolecular circuits. Mathematical methods will be combined with experiments to study the infection dynamics of two viral systems in single cells. First, I will show how stochastic expression of proteins results in intercellular lysis time and viral burst size variations in the bacterial virus, lambda phage. Next, I will describe our efforts in stochastic analysis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) genetic circuitry. Our results show that HIV encodes a noisy promoter and stochastic expression of key viral regulatory proteins can drive HIV into latency, a drug-resistant state of the virus. **About the speaker:** Prof. Abhyudai Singh Singh earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India. He received master's degrees in both mechanical and electrical & computer engineering from Michigan State University and a master’s degree in ecology, evolution and marine biology from the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB). After earning his doctoral degree in electrical & computer engineering in 2008, also from UCSB, he completed postdoctoral work in UC San Diego’s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. From 2011 to 2017 he was an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware, and was promoted to Full Professor in 2021.

These vessels create networks that interact with every organ microenvironment of the body and influence their development and physiology. These networks showcase remarkable structural and functional diversity that is not fully understood despite its importance in homeostasis and disease. Traditionally vascular networks were often viewed as ‘pipelines’ within the body, passive structural conduits of fluid. In this talk, I will provide contradiction to this viewpoint, and explore the dynamic nature of vascular networks, presenting examples from my research that highlight their plasticity and diversity. I will also highlight the future work we are initiating at our nascent lab in SNIoE, and the exciting opportunities our zebrafish model system offers in investigating various biological processes and interdisciplinary research. **Venue**: D217 **Date**: 10 May 2024 **Time**: 12-1.30 PM **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/seminar-on-seesaw-determination-of-dark-matter-relic-density-with-dr-aritra-gupta/) [Next Article](/events/from-insects-to-humans-exploring-the-neurobiology-and-behavior-associated-with-movement/)

## Content
### Physics Of Neutron Stars One of the main goals of studying astrophysics and high-energy physics is to know the properties of matter under extreme conditions. Neutron stars are excellent astrophysical laboratories in this context, as all the properties that characterize a neutron star are extreme. We work on different models of neutron stars to understand their various astrophysical observations. Currently, we are interested in the following topics: * Constraining the Neutron stars' equation of state by using data from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, including gravitational waves. * Properties of Neutron Star crust. * Dynamical study of low-density nuclear matter relevant for Neutron Star crust and Supernova matter using molecular dynamics simulations on GPU platforms. * Study of hadron-quark phase transition inside Neutron Star core and its possible observational signatures. * Synthesis of heavy elements in binary Neutron Star mergers. * Understanding the physics of pulsar glitches. Various oscillation modes of Neutron Stars etc

The university's infrastructure is designed and implemented to avoid contamination, avoid waste, loss in transit, and enhanced reuse. We track the water use and reuse through measurement and maintenance of logs, and conduct analysis to identify opportunities and undertake initiatives for continual improvement. The data is annually submitted as a compliance requirement. * **[Shiv Nadar University Campus Water Management and Reuse Policy](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/shiv_nadar_university_water_mangement_and_reuse_policy_compressed_compressed.pdf)** * **[60+ arid and semi-arid plant species planted in Shiv Nadar University’s Thematic Botanic Garden](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/xerophytes_shivnadaruniversitycampus.pdf)** * [**M.Sc. in Water Science and Policy**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/wsp_2021_final.pdf) * [**Water Science and Policy SNU-IDRC Technical Report**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/water_science_and_policy_snu-idrc_technical_report_1.pdf) * [**Water Science and Policy student field work**](https://snu.edu.in/sustainability/water-science-and-policy-students-field-work/) * [**Water Conscious Buildings – Water conservation in plumbing design**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/planning_to_preliminary_design.pdf) * [**Systematic Water Metering**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/systematic_water_metering_jan_23__dec_23.pdf) * [**Water Conservation in Wider Communities**](https://snu.edu.in/sustainability/water-conservation-in-wider-communities/) ![850_3794](images/850_3794.jpg) ![shiv_nadar_university_-](images/shiv_nadar_university_-_august_2021_-_1727.jpg) ## Solar energy The university has a very ambitious plan to increase its solar power production from its current 430 KW capacity to 1150 KW by December 2023. This will reduce the use of non-renewable sources of energy by 30-35 percent. Leading by example, the university has set up infrastructure to promote the use of solar energy. The university has a very audacious plan to increase its solar power production to reduce the use of non-renewable sources. ## Energy conservation We are committed to judicious energy usage and energy optimization. We review energy use on a continual basis and identify the opportunities for improvement which are then implemented. A full analysis of energy consumption is reported on a monthly basis in the “Energy Performance Index Report” (since 2019). Taking 2019 as the base year for comparative analysis, this report documents the consumption of energy in each building. Accordingly, corrective measures are taken to reduce wastage on a continuous basis. * **[Shiv Nadar University Energy Consumption and Conservation Plan](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/shiv_nadar_university_energy_consumption_and_conservation_plan.pdf?v=2)** * [**Industrial collaboration - Services for Energy Efficiency and Waste Management**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/services_for_energy_efficiency_and_waste_management_industrial_collaboration_of_shiv_nadar.pdf) * [**ISO Certification: Environmental Management System**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/certificate_environmental_management_system.pdf) * [**Energy Conservation – Awareness session for local support staff**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/energy_conservation_-_awareness_session_for_local_support_staff.pdf) ****![screenshot_](images/screenshot_2022-12-10_at_11_31_28_am.jpg)**** ![screenshot_2022-12-11_141516](images/screenshot_2022-12-11_141516.jpg) ## Sewage treatment with latest technology We have a sewage treatment plant with latest technology. The sewage water is treated with Membrane Bio Reactor (MBR) technology. The treated water is also passed through a UV reactor before storing it in a treated water tank. * [**Sewage treatment plant with latest technology**](https://snu.edu.in/sustainability/sewage-treatment-plant-with-latest-technology/) * [**Efficient Waste Disposal System**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/efficient_waste_disposal_system.pdf) ## Sustainable buildings All buildings in the university campus are certified by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). Several buildings, including the sports complex are LEED Gold certified and several others are awaiting gold certification. The main feature of sustainable building are * Energy Efficiency. * Renewable Energy Generation. * Water Efficiency. * Stormwater Management. * Superior Indoor Environment. We have all these features built into in our building design; our practices to operate these buildings are towards conservation and sustainability. * **[ISO Certification: Occupational Health & Safety Management System](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/certificate_occupational_health_safety_management_system.pdf)** * **[Certifications achieved for Sustainable Building Design](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/certifications_-_sustainable_building_design.pdf)** * [**Planning and Development Policy**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/planning_and_development_policy_compressed.pdf) ![shiv_nadar_university_](images/shiv_nadar_university_-_august_2021_-_0056.jpg) ![layer_2](images/layer_2.jpg) ## Carbon footprint We measure our carbon footprint for Scope-1 (Direct emissions), Scope-2 (Purchased electricity), and Scope-3 (Indirect emissions). Taking the cumulative value of the carbon footprint (CFP) for Scope 1, 2, & 3 together. Our Scope 1 emissions in 2023–24 dropped significantly by 64.6% compared to the previous year's. For Scope 3, the emissions dropped by 45.8%. One of the major highlights this year is a 270% rise in renewable energy generation between the years 2019-20 to 2023-24. * [**Carbon Footprint Comparative**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/updated_draft_cfp_report_snu_202324.pdf?v=2) ## Partnerships for the Goals * [**Adoption of green area**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/adoption_of_green_area.pdf?v=2) * [**Collaboration with NGOs to advance the SDGs through education and field engagement**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/collaboration_with_ngos_to_advance_the_sdgs_through_education_and_field_engagement.pdf?v=2) * [**Shiv Nadar University leads in shaping regional SDG policies and sustainable community development**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/shiv_nadar_university_leads_in_shaping_regional_sdg_policies_and_sustainable_community_development.pdf?v=2) * [**International collaboration on SDG data gathering through IUCN red list assessments**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/16490/international_collaboration_on_sdg_data_gathering_through_iucn_red_list_assessments.pdf?v=2) ![](images/sustainability-banner_1.jpg) ![water-management_1](images/water-management_1.jpg) ## Environment, Health and Safety Management System The University has an active and robust EHS policy with the idea of embedding sustainability in its institutional practices. The policy aims to make effective and efficient use of university resources; minimize any adverse environmental impact; comply with relevant legislation, and encourage the university community to develop a sustainable approach to their work and lifestyle. The EHS policy applies at each stage of development of academics and extracurricular activities as well as services, from research to full-scale operation, in all its domains. Recognizing our community as an important asset, we are committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions for students, teachers, researchers, staff, and those visiting the campus. * [**Shiv Nadar University – Environment, Health and Safety Policy**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/shiv_nadar_university_-_environment-_health_and_safety_policy.pdf) * [**Shiv Nadar University EHS Management System**](https://snu.edu.in/site/assets/files/3875/snioe_ehs_ms_-_5_jun_23.pdf) ## Our Commitment [Our Commitment](/sustainability/our-commitment/)

# About | Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/centres/centre-of-excellence-for-himalayan-studies/about/

## Content
## About ![img_20231209_162930_1](images/img_20231209_162930_1.342x0-is-pid14011.jpg) The Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies under the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (SNIoE) is a research centre focussed on the economy, borders and identities, the environment and regional geopolitics of the wider Himalayan region including the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram. While there are scholars of the Himalayas and small centres and research groups focused on the region, there is a need for institutionalised efforts at the national level that brings together a wide variety of disciplinary and sectoral approaches to the study of what is one of the world’s most environmentally sensitive and politically fraught regions and one that simultaneously has a significant influence on the economic livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. At the same time, it is difficult to ignore the role of geopolitics in this region. Therefore, even as the Centre pushes for an approach to studying the Himalayas that crosses both national and disciplinary boundaries as well as engenders a three-way conversation between central and local governments, academia and the people who live in the region, it also remains sharply aware of and is attuned to geopolitics and the policy imperatives that surround it. The Centre reflects SNIoE’s global outlook and ambitions, focusing on engaging researchers with niche or specialised interest in the wider Himalayas, and identifying and creating a network of scholars in the field, both in India and externally, to support its work. This critical mass of scholars of and from the region will redress the longstanding neglect or asymmetrical representation of the Himalayas and beyond, in knowledge, discourse and policy interventions. It also aims to develop and utilise strong links with the policy community and government agencies in a mutually supportive exercise. The Centre also signifies a leadership role for the SNIoE, as it attempts to fill gaps in both academic and policy spaces. This leadership role is in keeping with the University’s identity and goals of promoting innovation, creativity and inter-disciplinary engagement in the field of Indian education. The Centre also offers the SNIoE’s own faculty and students opportunities to collaborate with counterparts from across the wider Himalayan region as well as those working on the region from elsewhere in the world.

# University celebrates 11th Convocation with many firsts

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/news/university-celebrates-11th-convocation-with-many-firsts/

## Content
![](images/artboard_1_2.1600x0.webp) ## University celebrates 11th Convocation with many firsts Shiv Nadar University celebrated excellence, diversity, hard work and gratitude on Saturday during the Eleventh Convocation. The state-of-the-art 120,000 sq. feet Indoor Sports Complex stood decked as proud grandparents, parents and siblings streamed in to fill the venue. The Class of 2025 graduated with many firsts – the largest batch to date, the highest number of Ph.D degree holders, the most diverse graduating batch, and the first batch of the university's rural development program. An emotion that Chancellor Shikhar Malhotra perfectly summed up. "What can be a greater reflection of Shiv Nadar University than a melting pot of India's best and brightest from all corners of the country? You represent diverse ideas and thoughts; we are all richer in each other's company. Shiv Nadar University has truly become a university for the country, by the country. Wherever you go in life, do embrace this diversity. What's a better example of diversity than a university founded by a Tamilan in Uttar Pradesh, whose chancellor is Punjabi and the Vice Chancellor is a Bengali Canadian?" said Malhotra. Giving their message to the graduating batch – Mr. Amitabh Kant, India's G20 Sherpa and Former CEO of NITI Aayog (Guest of Honour); Dr. V. Narayanan, Chairman of ISRO; Dr. Archana Sharma, Principal Staff Scientist at CERN, both honorary doctorate recipients – spoke about the limitless possibilities that New India has to offer even in the time of global turmoil. Delivering her report, Vice-Chancellor Professor Ananya Mukherjee welcomed the dignitaries and quipped, "Today, we are launching over 900 indigenously built missiles, and we are eagerly awaiting the news of their success." This convocation marked the university's largest graduating class, with 910 students. 696 undergraduate, 152 postgraduate, and 62 Ph.D. degrees were awarded across the School of Engineering, School of Natural Sciences, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and School of Management and Entrepreneurship. Various other outstanding academic performances were also recognized with special awards and distinctions. Shivani and Arvind Shorewala, parents of Tanisha Shorewala, who topped the School of Management and Entrepreneurship, said, "It's a very proud moment for us. She has passed her Bachelor of Management Studies with top honours. My message to her and all her batch mates is to go and conquer the word." Earlier, delivering his acceptance speech that was punctuated with applause, after receiving his honorary doctorate, Dr. V. Narayanan thanked his teachers, wife and parents for their support and dedicated the award to the 20,000 employees of the Department of Space. "The degree you hold today is a culmination of efforts by parents, primary, high school and senior school teachers, faculty, staff members, and gardeners. I salute the efforts made by all in helping the students graduate. One should also thank the country's taxpayers; each graduate here is responsible for paying back to society and being an agent of change. It is because of the idea by the great son of India, Mr. Shiv Nadar, that this great university is in place. I commend his visionary leadership in education and philanthropy. He is the son of the soil who has dared to dream and made a remarkable difference to the country," said Dr. Narayanan. Pradeep Kumar Sinha, Non-Executive Chairman of ICICI Bank; Former Cabinet Secretary, and Former Principal Advisor to the Prime Minister of India, was awarded his honorary doctorate in a separate ceremony on May 7, 2025. Addressing the batch of 2025, Amitabh Kant said, "Students, you are graduating at a time which, to my mind, is one of the most transformational periods in the world's history. Never before in the world have we seen such radical transformations in globalization. Many of you will play a critical role in transforming India and making it an innovative India. And I am sure that all of you will shape the future and bring pride to this great university." Delivering her acceptance speech after receiving her honorary doctorate, Dr. Archana Sharma said, "We need to bring transformations in industries, transformation in the way our young startup ecosystem is marching forward, and that momentum needs to embrace public-private partnerships to transform healthcare, for example. I believe that this is the time to leverage science, not only to understand the universe as I do at CERN, but to serve humanity. May we walk together, scientists, educators, entrepreneurs, and citizens, towards a future where knowledge is not a privilege but a light for all." The evening of the winners continued with the graduates receiving their degrees. The segment began with Bachelor of Science (Research) Physics student Idris Khorakiwala bagging the Gold Medal with a CGPA of 9.86; winning the Silver Medal was Bachelor of Arts (Research) History student Trinanjana Sen with a 9.77 CGPA. The topper of the School of Engineering was Saideep Kilaru from Computer Science and Engineering, with a CGPA of 9.47. As the graduates trickled out of the Indoor Sports Complex, some to party, others to celebrate with family, future plans loomed large, mixed with appreciation for their formative years at Shiv Nadar University.

This is known as ultrafast demagnetization. At longer time scale the precession of magnetization is observed. The damping associated with magnetization precession as well as spin waves are observed from subns to tens of ns time scale. In this talk I will describe two different systems showing two different magnetization dynamics at two different time scales. The first system is an antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic trilayer system which achieved huge attention of scientific community due to its potential applications in spintronic devices. We use tabletop high harmonic generation (HHG) in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime to investigate the underlying mechanisms for the M-edge spectroscopy at femtosecond time scale. The second system is a quasi - magnonic crystals [5,6] where spin waves, which are the fundamental magnetic excitation in a metallic ferromagnetic material with frequencies in the microwave regime, propagate in a similar fashion to electromagnetic waves in a photonic crystal. Both the observations have a significant impact on the fundamental understanding of the ultrafast processes and application of spinwaves in future spintronic devices.

![](images/precision_premier_ii_ferroelectric_loop_-tester-1.1600x0.webp) # Precision Premier II Ferroelectric Loop-Tester The Precision Premier II Ferroelectric loop-tester can execute a single pass hysteresis loop in 100μs without interlacing the data acquisition. Premier II uses a 40MHz clock through a down counter resulting in an effective maximum clock rate of 10MHz. The capture rate for the 18bit ADCs in the system is 2MHz. The maximum hysteresis frequency of the Premier II is 250 kHz. The driver for the Premier II interlaces multiple loops to generate an effective capture rate of 10MHz on hysteresis and a total loop period of 10μs. The Premier II will execute a PUND pulse measurement with pulse widths ranging from 0.5μs to 1s on capacitors with areas ranging from 0.5u2 up to multiple square centimeters. Along with the main setup, it is attached to a high voltage power amplifier (Trek Model 609B-3 is DC stable with an output voltage range from 0 to ±10 kV) via Precision 10KV High Voltage Interface and High Voltage Amplifier. The Premier II Ferroelectric Test System is driven, and Vision Software analyzes data. **Location** R-130, First Floor, Research Block **Contact Person** Dr. Parthapratim Munshi, FRSC

# Dance | School of Humanities and Social Sciences

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/research-areas/dance/

## Content
### Dance Dance is emerging as an emerging area of research within academia even though dance and its traditions have long been an ingrained cultural practice and an area of interest for other academic disciplines. Research in the department locates dance as an embodied knowledge system, braiding dance scholarship and practice to generate critical debate about what it means to dance in the contemporary moment. Questions such as- How is the past performed through dance and what relationship does it have to the future? Where is dance performed, how, and by whom? What are the systems, economic, political and social, that govern, enable, and disrupt the ways in which dance is produced and understood? underpin research in dance in this department. Pushing the envelope, both methodologically and conceptually, of the ways in which dance is made, performed, read, and written, research in dance is an interdisciplinary space where crucial questions of access, politics, pedagogy, patronage, and embodiment are generated.

## Content
![](images/product_fabrication_studio_2_1-1.1600x0.webp) # Product and Fabrication Studio A product idea at conception, sketched on a piece of paper, or digitally modelled in software is incomplete unless realised as a tangible entity. Product Modelling and Fabrication Studio facilitates this transition from an idea to a physical model or a prototype. This transition is an essential step in the design process and also allows novice designers to acquire fabrication skills and experience the fun of learning by doing. The studio is equipped with tools and machines for making scaled models and prototype products using various materials like metals, wood, clay, polymers etc. It is maintained and managed by 2 lab technicians trained and experienced in operating the tools and equipment. ## Studio Equipment: **Lathe Machine (KL-410-1000MM):** High precision lathe machine, furnished with different tools and accessories, is a vital fabrication equipment that performs a large variety of operations, including turning, facing, drilling, boring, parting to complex operations like tapering, internal and external threading, etc. It can be used for machining different materials like metals, wood, polymers, etc. **Bench Lathe cum Micro Milling Machine (M-4):** A bench lathe cum milling machine is a perfect combination of the two most important devices used for product fabrication. The duo enables performing multiple operations on the workpiece without removing or shifting the workpiece. This equipment is ideally suitable for machining small components and can be used for machining different materials like metals, wood, polymers, etc. **Hot Wire Cutting Machine:** Hot wire cutting machine (both table-top and hand-held) comes very handy in making a product mock-up using materials like Thermocol, Ecofoam, Rubbersole, High Impact Polystyrene (H.I.P.), Acrylic etc. **Welding Unit:** A well-equipped welding unit is capable of performing Arc welding as well as TIG welding. This unit can weld materials ranging from mild steel components, copper, and aluminium. The lightweight portable model gives it the flexibility to move if it is impossible for the workpiece to be moved. We also have a gas torch welding facility, a welding booth, and other accessories. **Wood Planer Machine:** A wood planer machine is an important piece of equipment for flattening and smoothing any wooden surface. Compared to traditional planer tools, this machine is quick and can precisely remove a smaller or large quantity of wood from the surface. The equipment enables the students to prototype products with high-quality finishes. **Table Saw:** A table saw is wood machining equipment that parts wood pieces of different dimensions precisely within a fraction of a second. This machine also facilitates wood cutting of varying thicknesses and angles with precision, which is required for fabricating different wooden products. **Vertical Milling Machine:** Vertical milling machine finds excellent utility in fabrication. It enables making any slots/grooves or removal of surface material at different depths from the workpiece and even performs drilling and boring operations. This machine can be used for machining various materials like metals, wood, polymers, etc. **Sander Machine:** Sander machine is useful for different material removal processes from workpiece surfaces. It plays a vital role in relieving the manual method using sandpaper. It is used to give the products a fine surface finish and is also very useful in product form development. It is used for machining metal, wood, nylon, acrylic, plaster of Paris, etc. **Location** B-Block, Ground Floor (Room No B003)

Research Project ### Surface Wetting And De-Wetting Multifunctional nanostructured surfaces with distinct coatings are important for their applications from industry to biomedical fields. Surface roughness and free energy play important role in achieving such applications. The aim of this project is to realise multifaceted applications of nanostructures surfaces depending upon their morphologies. This is achieved by tuning the synthesis parameters and performing further modifications by coating distinct materials, resulting in unique surface properties. These modifications are characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). These surfaces are also characterized for wettability analysis by measuring the static as well dynamic contact angles. Furthermore, the bactericidal properties of as synthesised surfaces are observed using spot assays and counting the colony forming units.

## Content
Research Project ### Viscoelasticity Of Complex Fluids Ionic liquids are the salts showing unique physiochemical properties of low melting point, good thermal stability, high solvation interactions and excellent ionic conductivity, along with the amphiphilic nature. These make them useful in the catalysis, extraction and separation, lubrication, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Because of their amphiphilic nature, the hydrophobic part tries to reduce contact with polar solvents, hence, aggregates into a micellar structure. As the number of aggregates in the system increases, they mimic a phase at a larger length scale, because of the inter-aggregate interactions. The evolution of phases with complex structure and variation of physical properties is of keen interest in the soft matter industry. In this project, ionic liquids are used to understand the morphological variation and phase evolution in the presence of external shear. The techniques of Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), rheology and Polarizing Optical Microscopy (POM) are used to deduce the variation in structures and phases in the system with changing the experimental parameters.

# 'India cannot grow by ignoring half its talent'

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/news/india-cannot-grow-by-ignoring-half-its-talent/

## Content
![](images/inside_picture.1600x0.webp) ## 'India cannot grow by ignoring half its talent' India’s economic and social ambitions will remain a distant dream unless women are given equal opportunity, investment and safety, Kanta Singh, Country Representative of UN Women India, has warned. Addressing a packed auditorium of faculty, students and staff at Shiv Nadar University on Tuesday, Singh delivered a stark message: gender inequality is the single biggest barrier holding India back. “Of all the Sustainable Development Goals, Goal Five – gender equality – is where we are lagging very badly,” she said. “It’s not just India; the story is the same across the world.” Singh highlighted the yawning global gap in ownership and access to resources. “Eighty-seven per cent of land across the world is owned by men,” she said. “When you are so discriminated against in terms of real assets, there’s very little likelihood that you will succeed.” The imbalance, she explained, filters into education and the workplace. While women constitute 45 per cent of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), only 17 per cent eventually enter the workforce. “Girls are prepared for marriage rather than careers,” Singh said. “Fortunately, more young women are now resisting that pressure, but the expectation still weighs heavily.” Even for those who aspire to break out of these roles, safety remains a crippling barrier. “Every third woman has faced violence, and in practice it is closer to two out of three,” Singh said bluntly. “I haven’t met a single woman who hasn’t faced violence – at home, in public spaces or at work.” She urged institutions, particularly universities, to consciously brand themselves as safe spaces. “Without safety, opportunity does not matter,” she warned. Singh reserved some of her strongest criticism for the way Indian society limits the aspirations of young women. “Go across the country and ask a young woman what she wants to become. She never says ‘housewife’. Nobody invests in her dreams, nobody asks her. That’s why she cannot imagine being a leader – and even if she does, she is afraid she won’t get there.” She added that women often train themselves for narrow roles because that is what society offers them. “Your dreams are only as big as your exposure. If you’ve had good teachers and schools, your dreams are big. But most girls are denied that exposure.” Opening her speech, Singh drew on the lessons of sport to inspire the audience. “Sport teaches you it’s okay to lose – you should not be defeated. Success and achievement are two different things,” she said, urging young women not to fear failure. The argument for gender equality, Singh stressed, is not just moral but economic. She drew a direct line between women’s participation in the workforce and national prosperity. “All developed countries have one thing in common – women in the workforce. If we are only choosing from 50 per cent of the talent pool, how can we expect to become a $5 trillion economy? A leader sets a vision and removes hurdles for others. You can be a leader in a community, in a home, in any profession. What matters is that we start investing in women’s education, in their dreams, and in their opportunities,” she said. The session also featured a fireside chat with Shikhar Malhotra, Chancellor of Shiv Nadar University, who pointed to the institution’s ethos as rooted in progressive values instilled by founder Shiv Nadar. The fireside chat was moderated by Dr. Rajat Kathuria, Dean, School of Humanities and Social Sciences. “It’s a bit of a funny topic at home,” Malhotra quipped, referring to the strong female role models in his own life. “I’m married to a woman who happens to be on the Fortune and Forbes list of the world’s 100 most powerful women. My mother-in-law is an Asian Games and Commonwealth Games medallist in bridge. And our Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ananya Mukherjee, leads an Institution of Eminence. The values we hold at Shiv Nadar University reflect that progressive vision.” Malhotra emphasised the university’s commitment to creating an ecosystem where women can thrive. “We continue to build an environment where women can lead, innovate and inspire,” he said. Her closing message was clear: boys and men must also be part of the change. “If boys are prepared to have a workforce around them that includes women, we can transform this nation. India cannot grow by ignoring half its talent.” [Previous Article](/events/2nd-conference-on-domestic-governance-in-china/) [Next Article](/events/india-and-japan-in-an-age-of-fragmentation/)

As a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA from 1996-2001, he studied cancer biology. Dr. Galande joined the National Centre for Cell Science in Pune, India in 2001 as a senior scientist. In 2010 Dr. Galande joined as a Professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER Pune). Research in Galande laboratory is focused on studying how the dynamic changes in higher-order chromatin assembly govern gene expression in a spatial and temporal manner. At IISER Pune he led the Centre of Excellence in Epigenetics (CoEE) and assembled a team of scientists to study the evolution of epigenetic mechanisms using multiple model systems. The CoE in Epigenetics focuses on epigenetic modifications underlying variety of biologically important phenomena and their role in gene expression, regeneration, cancer, behavior, aging and evolution. To fulfill these goals Dr. Galande has established a multidisciplinary program engaged at the interface of biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, cell biology, proteomics and genomics. In June 2021, Dr. Galande joined as the Dean of the School of Natural Sciences at Shiv Nadar University (SNU), Delhi NCR. At SNU, Dr. Galande has initiated the new phase of Centre of Excellence in Epigenetics and continued working on many of the leads obtained in the first phase.

The seminar will be held online. This article strives to respond to the possibilities of collaborative research on atmospheres during a pandemic that reformulated modes of doing and communicating research. Our general interest is methodological with a focus on how encounters may happen across geographical remoteness and what such encounters may expose. More specifically we explore this interest by revisiting our respective research – on air in India and wind in Patagonia – bringing in the idea of collaboration as contamination, while acknowledging its historicity, i.e. transformations over time through entanglements between humans and nonhumans. We argue that by paying close attention to nuances and discourses of contamination we can make sense of air as it operates in varying intensities. By rethinking contamination as entangled encounters between kinds and looking at how and with what air relates in each fieldsite, we find that it is its un-graspability that makes air a protagonist. A situated notion of ‘social distancing’ may further provide tools for an analysis of the relatedness of air. We conclude that, alertness to the fact that any anthropology of air is a process of siting the un-sitable, and it is precisely the necessary methodological move that makes a collaboration of air in distant places rewarding. Dr. Annika Capelán holds a Ph.D. in Social Anthropology and is a EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Global Fellow 2022-2024, jointly hosted by Aarhus University, Denmark and the University of Cape Town, South Africa. CORDIS project description: <https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101027138> Her research focuses on historical, environmental and political aspects of sheep farming and industrial wool production on the Patagonian, Australian and South African grasslands. She works with ethnographic methods with an emphasis on participant observations, and a special interest in visual and collaborative knowledge building. Dr. Vasundhara Bhojvaid is Assistant Professor at the Department of Sociology, Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR. Her current work looks at how air pollution is effecting and effected by policies, transforming life in urban spaces and understandings of the body. This is informed by her broader interests in how air pollution has close intersections with climate change and is charting new ways in which to anthropologically explore the contemporary. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/school-of-management-entrepreneurship-organizing-a-seminar-on-gamified-health-a-phenomenological-inquiry-of-mental-and-physical/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-life-sciences-organizes-seminar-on-multiscale-modeling-of-human-disease-biology-from-molecules-to-patients/)

## Content
### Forms of religious life We draw inspiration from the classic Durkheimian idea that religious life is its own form—a form that lives in great intimacy with the social. Exploring the relations between the forms of religious life and the forms of social life is an important aspect of our research at the department. Contemporary empirical interfaces show that religious life and the boundaries of its self-enclosed normativity have given way to multiple different expressions and experiences of the social. The fact of the social inheres as individuals creatively activate, embody, and negotiate forms of life contained in various religious traditions through rituals, discourses, and practices. Inflected by the forces of the modern, secular and the post-modern, we locate how this social is recalibrated into the present within the select domains of hierarchy, inequality, caste, theology, cosmology, mind, body, spirituality, health, death, funeral, and grief.

## Content
### Development, Regeneration and Repair # Development, Regeneration and Repair We focus on cellular and molecular principles governing the important processes for tissue, organ and organism development, regeneration and repair. We study these in multiple invertebrate, vertebrate and in vitro systems. model systems, as well as in organisms ranging from Hydra to mammalian models and utilize our state-of-the-art facilities for animal research (CITRes, Fly facility), Epigenetics Research (COEE), Imaging (Imaging facility), NGS and mass spectrometry. ## Research Groups ## Colin Jamora ![Description](images/untitled-1artboard_1_copy.jpg) Our laboratory aims to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue regeneration and repair for therapeutic applications. We use genetic engineering, cell biology, and quantitative biology to study tissue homeostasis, with a focus on skin. As one of the few tissues that regenerates cyclically throughout life, the skin epithelium also has a remarkable ability to rapidly repair itself after injury. Using this as our experimental paradigm, our research focuses on two key areas: (1) the early cellular events that trigger wound healing and transition epidermal keratinocytes from homeostasis to repair, and (2) the interactions between the extracellular matrix, vasculature, inflammatory cells, and fibroblasts that drive scar formation and fibrosis. These studies provide insight into diseases linked to wound-healing mechanisms, reinforcing the “wound signature” hypothesis. While rooted in fundamental skin biology, our work also has strong translational potential, fostering collaborations with the pharmaceutical and biotech industries to develop novel therapies. ![](images/picture3_edited.562x0-is-pid20161.jpg) *Model of Caspase-1 mediated HFSC homing to the epidermis upon wounding. Stressed epidermal keratinocytes secret Caspase-1 to the extracellular milieu upon wounding, UV exposure or genetic ablation of Caspase-8. Via caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of caspase-1, hair follicle stem cells are coaxed to migrate to the epidermis.

Exocrine glands play a crucial role in human physiology by secreting digestive enzymes, surfactants, mucus, and hormones onto epithelial surfaces to regulate cell signaling, metabolism, and immune defense functions. Exocrine secretion relies on giant, micron-sized vesicles, which fuse with the apical surface of cells upon stimulation. Traditionally, this process was believed to occur via full-collapse exocytosis, but such a mechanism would add tremendous amounts of membranes to the cell surface, disrupting surface homeostasis in terms of size, shape, and composition. Using live-cell super-resolution imaging, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), and biophysical assays in Drosophila larval salivary glands and mouse acinar pancreases ex vivo primary culture models, we uncovered a novel pathway of exocytosis. We found that, after fusion, vesicle membranes undergo dynamic remodeling and crumpling, ensuring mechanical sequestration of the vesicular membrane while allowing complete cargo extrusion—without apical surface expansion. We refer to this as Membrane Crumpling-mediated Exocytosis (Mem-CruX). Using live-imaging and quantitative analysis with biochemistry, our research aims to identify key molecular remodelers involved in the Mem-CruX process and investigate how errors in membrane remodeling contribute to secretory dysfunctions and disease states (like pancreatic and pulmonary insufficiencies), providing insights for targeted therapeutic interventions in exocrine disorders. ![](images/picture4_edited.jpg)***Top Panel**: Live imaging of vesicular secretion captured using Airy Scan super-resolution microscopy, showing the membrane crumpling process during exocytosis.* ***Bottom Panel**: Schematic representation of the Membrane Crumpling-Mediated Exocytosis (Mem-CruX) pathway. Following vesicle fusion with the apical surface, a diffusion barrier is established at the interface, preserving the physicochemical properties of the apical membrane while keeping the vesicle membrane distinct. Next, actomyosin machinery is recruited to the fused vesicle membrane, initiating progressive crumpling and folding. This enables efficient cargo extrusion while mechanically sequestering the vesicle membrane, preventing apical surface expansion. Subsequent to cargo release, the crumpled vesicle membrane undergoes targeted endocytosis via the clathrin-mediated pathway, ensuring membrane recycling and homeostasis. While the mechanical and structural framework of Mem-CruX is emerging, the molecular players orchestrating this process remain unexplored, representing a key focus of our ongoing research.* ## Projects/Highlights * Live-Imaging Candidate Screen & Characterization – Identify and analyze membrane remodelers involved in Mem-CruX using the Drosophila 3rd instar larval salivary gland model. * Role of Lipid Regulators in Mem-CruX – Investigate how lipids and their modifying enzymes contribute to vesicle membrane crumpling and homeostasis. * Biochemical Isolation & Molecular Characterization of Secretory Vesicles – Purify and analyze secreting vesicles from mouse pancreatic acinar cells to identify key molecular components of Mem-CruX. * Fate of Endocytosed Vesicular Membrane – Determine how endocytosed vesicle membranes are processed and recycled following Mem-CruX. * Biophysical Properties of the Apical Surface & Vesicle Membrane – Characterize the mechanical and physicochemical properties of the apical membrane, vesicle membrane, and cargo regulating Mem-CruX. * Impact of Inflammation & Injury on Mem-CruX Dynamics – Examine how inflammatory signals and cellular injury influence Mem-CruX in pancreatic acinar cells and lung alveoli. ## Key Publications 1.

While cell types segregate functions, body plans organize them to ensure efficient, integrated activity. Morphological diversity reflects the various solutions organisms have adopted for survival in diverse environments. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of cell types and tissue organization is a fundamental question in biology. This knowledge is crucial for elucidating how diseases or disorders arise from cellular dysfunction and misassembly during development. It also provides insights into unique processes such as regeneration and the emergence of specialized cell types and functions that enhance survival. Addressing these questions is the long-term focus of my research. Early-branching basal metazoans with simple well-defined body plans and cell types comparable to those in bilaterians offer powerful models for exploring these evolutionary questions. *Hydra*, a member of the phylum Cnidaria, is particularly valuable due to its simple oral-aboral axis, the emergence of key cell types such as neurons and muscle cells, and its exceptional regenerative capacity. *Hydra*’s remarkable tissue dynamics enable continuous axis patterning, making it an ideal system for investigating the molecular networks driving body axis development and regeneration. ![](images/picture1pali.jpg) *Left Panel:* *Conserved and newly identified homologs of bilaterian genes involved in axis patterning and regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in Hydra.

These complex LV/BV systems, composed of endothelial cells (ECs), engage in close interactions with diverse organ microenvironments. Our focus lies in unraveling how ECs develop distinct vessel and organ-specific identities and understanding their vital roles in organ development, function and regeneration. ![](images/picture_edited.562x0-is-pid20161.jpg) *We investigate organ-associated vascular diversity through three broad question: Where, why and how? In the where questions, we characterize the vascular populations in different organs through confocal microscopy and RNA sequencing. In the how questions, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these organ-associated vascular specializations. In the why questions, we explore the functional aspects of these specializations and focus on how these are associated with various vasculopathies or regeneration mechanism.* ## Projects/Highlights * Regulation of Lymphatic Vessel specialization and gene regulation: We aim to understand how lymphatic vessels develop in different organs and acquire organ-specific specializations. We investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying such these specializations. * Zebrafish model for vascular biology: We use zebrafish model system, with extensive utilization of confocal microscopy, CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, transgenesis and NGS analysis. * Vascular malformations and dysfunction models: Identification of the molecular correlates underlying vascular Malformation and dysfunction using the pre-clinical in vivo zebrafish model system. * Regeneration: Zebrafish is an excellent model for regeneration. We investigate revascularization of regenerating organs. ## Key Publications 1. Das RN, Tevet Y, Safriel S, et al. Generation of specialized blood vessels via lymphatic transdifferentiation.

Our research primarily focuses on cellular signaling pathways and epigenetic modifiers that influence the chromatin landscape, ultimately shaping cellular phenotypes across different biological contexts. ## Zebrafish Group We are interested in exploring the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell fate decisions during different stages of zebrafish development. We focus on the genetic and epigenetic control of cell fate specification and cellular movements, particularly during gastrulation and organogenesis. By integrating genetic, imaging, and genome-wide approaches, we aim to identify and characterize novel vertebrate lineage-specific transcriptional regulators. Through investigating the interplay between chromatin modifications and transcriptional control, our research seeks to uncover the regulatory mechanisms shaping cell fate decisions. ![](images/picture1_edited.561x0-is-pid20161.jpg)*Precise gene expression is orchestrated by the interplay between multiple transcription factors and epigenomic marks, both of which can function as activators or repressors. These regulatory elements work in concert to modulate chromatin accessibility, leading to dynamic transitions between permissive and restrictive states. Such changes influence the recruitment of transcriptional machinery, ensuring proper gene regulation across different stages of development.* ## Hydra Group Hydra – the freshwater Cnidarian – is renowned for its robust regenerative potential. With a minimalistic body plan, well-defined regions of stem cell proliferation and differentiation, and established pharmacological and genetic perturbation methods, Hydra has a shining track record as a model to study the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms and the consequences of their perturbation for functional comprehension. The Hydra research group is focused on unveiling conserved genetic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms and pathways in morphogenesis and regeneration. ![](images/picture2_edited.556x0-is-pid20161.jpg) ## Projects/Highlights * Investigating the role of Satb2 as a gatekeeper of developmental transitions in early vertebrate embryogenesis. * Role of chromatin organization in controlling cell fate specification and morphogenesis during early vertebrate development. * Role of Sp1 in organogenesis, focusing on transcriptional control in the gastrointestinal tract. * Function of histone post-translational modifications in regulating gene expression during early embryogenesis, shaping developmental trajectories. * Wnt signalling cascade and downstream targets in head organizer formation * Enhancer switching in head organizer establishment * Role of tissue stiffness in Hydra regeneration and motility * Crosstalk of signalling pathways in tissue boundary maintenance * Evolutionary epitranscriptomics of cell fate determination * Epigenomic landscape determining promoter and enhancer dynamics ## Key Publications 1.

The liver can rebuild itself, but the efficiency of this process varies with age and disease. Using partial hepatectomy—a model that mimics a clinical procedure—we study how cell plasticity drives regeneration and have found this process is enhanced during growth spurts. We also investigate liver atrophy during prolonged starvation, mechanisms of liver failure in alcohol-induced damage, and strategies to enhance liver resilience in cancer. By integrating single-cell transcriptomics, live imaging, and CRISPR-based gene editing, we map how liver cells adapt to injury and metabolic challenges. These insights provide a foundation for developing strategies to improve liver regeneration and resilience in disease contexts. Our work bridges developmental biology, metabolism, and regenerative medicine, offering new perspectives on organ repair and disease progression. ![](images/picture4sps.png) *(From Left to Right) Inflammation in liver upon starvation; regenerative response to partial hepatectomy; hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in a growing liver; lipid droplets in the liver.* ## Projects/Highlights * Cellular plasticity and regeneration in liver repair * Starvation as a driver of liver atrophy and metabolic adaptation * Mechanisms of liver failure and resilience in cancer and alcohol-induced damage * Single-cell and imaging approaches to dissect liver regeneration * Intersection of developmental biology, metabolism, and regenerative medicine ## Key Publications 1.

## Content
![](images/sociology_banner_1.1600x0.webp) # Department of Sociology The Department of Sociology is committed to a productive and responsible understanding of contemporary society. Keeping abreast of global and local shifts in social life, in our economic, political, cultural, and everyday lives, we train our students to critically engage with their environment with a robust sociological grounding and interdisciplinary sensitivity. With a focus on emerging planetary concerns of health, security, poverty, sustainability, technology, law, and governance, our research and teaching programs are equally grounded in classical and contemporary approaches to themes like family and kinship, religion and ritual, difference and hierarchy, rural and urban, art and aesthetics, and sound and sensorium. The pedagogic routine at the department adheres to benchmarks of social science excellence in rigorous methodology and theoretical debates. As a department, we focus on a profile that can sustain and enable research within the Indian sub-continent and encourage connections and conversations -- analytical, ethnographic, and archival -- with locations around the region and globally. Our faculty are engaged in active research and writing on science and technology studies; sonic and visual cultures; religion and identity, mind and body; climate change and social ecologies; law and governance, and life and biophilosophies. Our faculty's engagement in ongoing discussions and debates speaks of our emerging leadership in the discipline. In addition to taught courses, the B.A Sociology (research) degree at SNU offers an opportunity for undergraduate students to write a research thesis under supervision. The entire program, including the final year thesis, prepares students for a career in sociology or social anthropology. It gives them insight and knowledge skills to tackle any future they choose. The SNU Sociology degree combines its theoretical curriculum and practical hands-on training with field visits, internship opportunities, teaching workshop style, and student-driven classroom discussions. Our students can enter professional fields like development, media, journalism, bureaucracy, and writing, among many other emerging careers. Our sought-after, fully funded Ph.D. program involves a specially designed year of disciplinary and multi-perspective training on theory and method. Our competitive students come from various social sciences and other disciplinary backgrounds, and have opportunities to participate in school-wide graduate classrooms and seminars, enabling a nuanced approach to any research endeavor. Our newly launched MA programme is unique in that we offer a one year joint MA in Global Urban Sociology with SOAS University of London, UK. The Department of Sociology, Shiv Nadar University in collaboration with the Department of Anthropology, and Sociology, SOAS, University of London, offers a joint MA in Global Urban Sociology. ## Explore Programs under the Department of Sociology * [Joint MA Global Urban Sociology](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/programs/shiv-nadar-ioe-soas-joint-ma-global-urban-sociology/) * [Ph.D. in Sociology](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/programs/phd-in-sociology/) ## Faculty at Department of Sociology [![Anita Sharma](images/anita_sharma.340x340.1600x0.webp)](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/faculty/anita-sharma/) ##### [Anita Sharma](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/faculty/anita-sharma/) Assistant Professor School of Humanities and Social Sciences ###### Department of Sociology [![Devika Bordia](images/bordiaprof.340x340.1600x0.webp)](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/faculty/devika-bordia/) ##### [Devika Bordia](/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/faculty/devika-bordia/) Associate Professor School of Humanities and Social Sciences ###### Department of Sociology [![P.

# Theoretical insights into monovalent-metal-cation transmutation effects on lead-free halide double perovskites for optoelectronic applications (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.075401) | School of Natural Sciences

Research Project ### Theoretical insights into monovalent-metal-cation transmutation effects on lead-free halide double perovskites for optoelectronic applications (DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.7.075401) Alternative halide perovskites with characteristics similar to CsPbX3 perovskites have sparked interest over the past decade due to lead-induced toxicity and material instability. Here we utilize the technique of cation transmutation to create inorganic Pb-free halide double perovskites Cs2MSbX6 (M = Cu, Ag, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and X = Cl, Br) and comprehensively study them from the perspective of their potential use in optoelectronic devices. Our first-principles density-functional-theory–based calculations reveal that all of these materials exhibit a cubic lattice with excellent phase stability against decomposition. Further, these systems are found to be mechanically stable and ductile in nature, with some amount of elastic anisotropy, which makes them an excellent choice for flexible materials. These materials are also found to possess interesting electronic and optical properties. While upon having M = Cu, Ag, Na in Cs2MSbX6, the system possesses an indirect band gap with a value ranging between ∼1.19 and 4.82 eV, a transition to direct band gap with values between ∼4.50 and 5.22 eV occurs on having heavier metals with M = K, Rb, Cs. In accordance with the band gap, most of the systems are also found to exhibit excellent absorption capabilities from visible to near-ultraviolet light. Furthermore, investigations of transport and excitonic properties indicate low effective mass, excellent charge-carrier mobility (∼10–10^3 cm2 V−1 s−1), low to moderate exciton binding energy, and longer to shorter exciton lifetimes for most of the examined materials, suggesting higher quantum yield and conversion efficiency of the examined materials. Overall, our study suggests that with atomic transmutation in Cs2MSbX6, stable and flexible lead-free halide double perovskites with superior and tunable optoelectronic properties can be achieved, which makes these materials excellent candidates for flexible optoelectronic devices, in general, and photovoltaics in particular.

Furthermore, I will also discuss our work on bio-inspired neuromorphic computing. Notably, our recent breakthroughs have culminated in the successful demonstration of wafer-scale 2-tier and 3-tier 3D integration, utilizing MoS2 and WSe2 FETs as the building blocks. These achievements have paved the way for multifunctional circuits that hold immense promise for the future of electronics. Delving deeper into our research, we have harnessed the potential of 2D materials to design solid-state devices with low power consumption mimicking auditory processing in barn owl, collision avoidance in locust, and probabilistic computing in dragonfly. By combining the power of 2D materials with bio-inspired principles, our work lays a solid foundation for the creation of highly compact and functionally diverse integrated circuits in the revolutionary third dimension.

The title of the presentation is “Treatment of domestic sewage and leachate using a moving bed hybrid bioreactor” The treatment of domestic sewage using a moving bed hybrid bioreactor (MBHBR) was investigated by varying the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD) (156±14-1141±78 mg/L), ammonia (NH3-N) (2±0.08-48.24±0.93 mg/L), phosphorus (PO4-P) (97±3.2-281±2.65 mg/L), and hydraulic retention times (HRTs). Initially, the reactor was operated at start-up mode (COD: 156±14 mg/L), and gradually the COD concentrations were increased from phase-I (257±24 mg/L) to phase-V (1141±78 mg/L) by reducing the HRTs from 48 to 3 h. A significant improvement in COD removal, maximum up to 96%, was observed at a concentration of 858±51 mg/L (phase-IV), then a sudden drop up to 81% was observed at a higher concentration of 1141±78 mg/L (phase-V). Due to the increase in COD concentrations, average NH3-N removal was dropped from 85 to 32% from phase-I to Phase-V, respectively. In addition, the stability of MBHBR was studied to understand its performance in shutdown and shock loading phases. The co-treatment of sewage and leachate was also performed in MBHBR (COD: 864-881 mg/L and HRT: 6 h), which showed a COD removal of 77-80% and NH3-N removal of 60-94%. Proteobacteria was identified as a predominant species in MBHBR, which played a significant role in the co-treatment of sewage and leachate. The maximum biodegradation rate (rmax) and half-saturation constant (Ks) were estimated as 13.3 mg/L h and 361.8 mg/L, respectively. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/leadership-conclave-chapter-2-on-transformational-leadership-virtual-panel-discussion-on-gender-equality-today-for-sustainable-1/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-physical-education-is-organizing-a-six-a-side-rapid-football-tournament/)

The initial conditions of QGP are akin to inhomogeneities in the early universe that led to the formation of large-scale structures. The complex liquid expands, then cools and finally produces neutrons and protons and all the matter around us. In this talk, I will discuss on the novel properties of the quark-gluon plasma that we have learned from rigorous experimental and theoretical studies. I will emphasize on theoretical developments on collective flow of QGP and tomography of quark-gluon jets, and possible future directions on framing the nuclear matter phase diagram.

## Content
![](images/rh-1-1.1600x0.webp) # River Hydraulics Laboratory India being endowed with a vast river network; primary settings is conducive for growth of inland water transport (IWT). The navigation logjams could be nullified by providing low-cost, sustainable, and climate resilient all-weather fairway to commercial end-users on dependable terms. Mass cargo transport capacity at cheaper cost is the prime advantage of IWT over other competing transportation modes and this favourably reflects on commercial pricing of manufactured goods which elevates the competitiveness of export products in international markets. Markedly, it should be underlined here that technology for low-cost eco-friendly navigation fairway development calls for a skilled and pragmatic synthesis of complex multi-disciplinary knowledge domains, transcending beyond the conventional fluvial hydraulics, eco-hydrology, water resources, hydro-biology. In the above context, research focus will be on: * Maintaining minimum water depth * River channelization * Develop and maintain fairway on sustainable basis without exclusively relying on recurrent large scale dredging operations by incurring substantial recurring expenditure Irrigation and water security. * Development of low-cost riverbank protection techniques such as Jack Jetty, CHEVRON, submerged vanes, bank vegetation etc. * Study of hydraulic design and operational issues in hydraulic structures such as bridges across rivers, guide bunds and river training works. * Study of turbulent and secondary flows that are liable for sediment transport process in open channel. * The emerging technologies such as remote sensing and data analysis tools will be used in the above said focused research with domain knowledge. The main aim of the research will be to come up with the solutions that can implemented for navigation channel development and river bank protection. ## Laboratory Resources and Infrastructure River Engineering field laboratory has been developed at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR that includes an extensive research facility for experimentation on river water management. For research studies on river water management and complex geophysical flow phenomena, a field experimental flume has been created. The size of the flume is 15 m long, 1.5 m wide and 1 m deep. A recirculating channel of 20 m is also created to transfer the flowing water to the reservoir. With this flume facility, it is feasible to study the following aspects. * Sediment transport processes in straight and meandering rivers * Dam safety * Inland navigation * Riverbank protection * Flow over grade-control structures (spillway and weir) * Scouring around the hydraulic structure * Turbulence in rivers under the influence of gravels and vegetation, etc. The laboratory is equipped with: * **Water storage tank**: A water reservoir of 9 m long, 6 m wide, and 2 m deep is constructed to store the water. Two outlet pipes are connected to the tank to take the water from the reservoir to the flume with the help of a submersible pump**.** * **Pump:** Two pumps are used to transfer the water to the field flume with an adequate rate without any interruptions. The efficiency of two pumps is 10 HP each. * **Flow meter**: Two flow meters are used to regulate the flow rate of the water that goes into the flume for experimental work. Each flow meter has a capacity to pass 120 l/s of water. * **A** **Settling chamber** to conduct flow measurement or parameter monitoring. Besides, an **Inlet gate and honeycomb structure** are provided to control and dampen the perturbation of water generated due to vibration. ![](images/rh-2.1600x0-is-pid16113.jpg) ## Equipment Facility Different equipment are being used to measure and record the water and bed topography in the experimental field flume using different digital gauges before and after the experimentation. The facility is equipped with field research equipment such as: **Acoustic Doppler velocimetry (ADV):** It is engineered to instantly record velocity components at a single location with a relatively high frequency. It accomplishes this by measuring the velocity of particles within a remote sampling volume based on the Doppler shift effect. The utilization of the Doppler shift effect allows for precise measurement of particle velocities in the fluid, contributing to a comprehensive analysis of fluid dynamics. **Pitot static tube:** This probe concurrently assesses both stagnation pressure and static pressure, providing the essential parameters for calculating the flow speed. This is mainly used to measure water velocity in our open channel flow experiments. **Laser digital gauge:** A depth gauge is an instrument for measuring depth below a vertical reference surface. It provides accurate information for an uneven surface, such as the nonuniform distribution of the sedimented surface. **Manual vernier pointer gauge:** A depth gauge is an instrument for measuring depth below a vertical reference surface. It is helpful for measuring the water surface profile. ![](images/rh-3.1600x0-is-pid16113.jpg) **Images From the Lab** ![](images/rh-4.1600x0-is-pid16113.jpg) **Doctoral Research Students** * Vikalp Chauhan (July 2019 - present) * Nishank Agrawal (August 2021 - present) * Sumit Kumar Giri (January 2023 - present)

Just as the 19th century was called the Machine Age and the 20th century the Information Age, the 21st century promises to go down in history as the Quantum Age. Quantum Computing promises unprecedented speed in solving certain classes of problems while Quantum Cryptography promises unconditional security in communications. In this talk, I will discuss the world of single and entangled photons and also discuss ongoing work towards quantum communications, quantum information and quantum computing in our Quantum Information and Computing lab at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, India. I will primarily focus on four recent experiments from our lab, all of which use quantum interference as a resource but for very different end goals. The first experiment [1] discusses a new quantum state estimation method "Quantum State Interferography" which promises tremendous resource advantage over the more conventional quantum state tomography approaches. The second uses interference in a specific quantum information processing task, wherein we demonstrate the first loophole free violation of the Leggett Garg Inequality using a photonic architecture [2]. The third uses interference for a quantum communication advantage [3] whereas the final work demonstrates the first unambiguous Quantum Cheshire Cat phenomenon, again using interference, while bringing in a new understanding of Bohr's Complementarity principle[4]. I will end with our broad vision for the future, which includes establishment of long distance secure quantum communications in India and beyond involving satellite based, fibre based as well as integrated photonics based approaches towards the global quantum internet. 1.

## Content
Research Project ### Analysis Using functional analysis, operator theory, frame theory, harmonic analysis, matrix analysis, function theory, and dynamical systems, research is conducted on positive semi-definite matrices and Hilbert spaces. Positive semi-definite matrices arise in various basic sciences, engineering, and operations research applications. Copositive matrices, semimonotone matrices, and other generalizations like P0-matrices of positive semi-definite matrices play a significant role in the theory of linear complementarity problem (LCP). We aim to exploit the LCP theory to characterize these matrix classes with the motivation further that these characterizations will be highly useful not only in optimization theory but also in the applications like block designs, data mining and clustering, a model of energy demand, exchangeable probability distributions, and in dynamical systems and control. **Faculty** * Dr. Sneh Lata, Asst.

To this end, Ms. Das has developed a dynamic structural life-cycle model of female labor supply, savings, and Social Security benefit claiming and estimate the model using the Method of Simulated Moments for the 1943-1954 cohort. Ms. Das used the estimated model to quantify the effect of three revenue-neutral counterfactual policy reforms: (i) introducing a Social Security caregiver credit that covers the lost earnings during the first 5 child-rearing years through changes in retirement benefits, (ii) combining the introduction of caregiver credit with the elimination of spousal and survivors benefits, and (iii) removing spousal and survivors benefits. The researcher found that the gender gap in average career earnings at the Social Security Early Retirement Age reduces significantly under all three counterfactual scenarios, with the largest effect of 12.77% decline under the second reform. The findings suggest that instituting caregiver credit for child-rearing in the absence of the marriage-based Social Security benefits would offset a substantial portion of the motherhood penalty in lifetime labor earnings of married women and increase their retirement benefit adequacy. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-physical-education-presents-squash-tournament/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-mathematics-organizes-winter-school-on-evolutionary-game-theory/)

# Mapping the Legal Landscape of Himalayan Springs: Where Indian States Stand and How to Move Forward | Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies

Communities often manage springs independently, facing significant conservation challenges. Ownership varies; some springs are private, while others are communal, which affects the state’s efforts where they exist. Administrative boundaries can hinder cooperation, as springs span multiple villages or towns. Indian Himalayan states have legal frameworks that recognise the importance of spring and regulate its management. This issue brief analyses how 12 Himalayan states and UTs govern springs, categorising regions into Northeast India, the West Bengal Hills, and the Western Himalaya. Multiple legal instruments can have the same or varying levels of engagement. The Northeast has the highest engagement, followed by the West Bengal Hills while the Western Himalaya need improvement. Legal plurality should be central to spring governance, involving state, traditional, and customary laws. Assessing legal frameworks is vital since springs are owned and governed by various entities – state, community, private – and extend beyond water to forestry, municipalities, panchayats, hydropower, and mining. **Keywords:** Springs; the Himalayas; Conservation; Legal Instruments; Water Rights Springs, the primary water sources for the mountain communities, are decreasing in number and deteriorating in quality (Wani 2025; Agarwal et al. 2015). Impending climate change and urbanization, along with the uncertainty of their impacts, are reducing springs’ discharge volumes and their capacity for recharge. In the face of these changes, it is increasingly challenging for communities that have been managing these springs without any state support, until recently, to continue and prepare for the impending water crisis (Sharma and Khawas 2025). Springs have diverse ownership, defined by law or by the rules and norms of communities, which acts as a barrier to establishing accountability for managing them or developing plans for conservation and sustainability. Spring aquifers often extend over large areas, sometimes covering more than one village, a ward, or even a town. These administrative boundaries influence collaboration, as the spring may be recharged in one village while its discharge benefits others. Springs can be considered private if they are located on private property, according to the law (Shah 2025). However, many community springs exist as they have been bequeathed by the landowners for public use, which the communities have mostly maintained, managed and sustained. The different perspectives of law and communities towards springs are vital in determining the effectiveness of their protection and conservation plans. Until recently, springs have received little state support for their conservation and management (Gupta and Kulkarni 2018; Government of India 2019). The Indian Himalayan States and Union Territories (UTs) – Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), Ladakh[[i]](#_edn1), Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, Tripura, Uttarakhand and West Bengal – have several legal instruments such as acts, bills, ordinances, policies, rules, and regulations, that govern water and directly address springs. Additionally, legal instruments, such as the Forest and Municipal Acts, incorporate the protection and management of springs even though they are not the primary water-associated institutions. All of them engage with springs in various ways, ranging from recognising their importance for management and sustainability to defining ownership and explicit protection plans. This issue brief seeks to explore how springs are regulated by law in the 12 Himalayan States and UTs by analysing the legal instruments that reference springs. The 12 states and UTs have been categorised into the following groups for regional analysis: Northeast India (NE - Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura), the Western Himalayan States and Union Territories (WH – Himachal Pradesh, J&K, Ladakh and Uttarakhand) as well as Darjeeling and Kalimpong Districts in West Bengal (DK). The examination’s findings are presented for the Northeast Region, the West Bengal Hills, and the Western Himalaya. **How are Springs Governed across Regions?** Many of the state’s legal instruments address water resources, including water supply and taxation (Annexure 1). Some instruments are specifically designed to monitor groundwater and water catchment areas. Instruments focused on catchments are typically customised for drinking water purposes. Additionally, springs are recognised under legislation that is not explicitly aimed at groundwater management. These include regulations and statutes from the Building, Forest, Municipality, and Irrigation departments, as well as the Hydropower Acts and Mineral Rules. The inclusion of springs in these instruments indicates awareness of both the benefits of springs and the adverse impacts of encroachment, pollution and industrial activities on springs. Forest conservation and protection help maintain the springs and their associated ecosystems. Building rules prevent encroachments on springs, and mining rules restrict alterations that could affect the flow and pollution of springs. The legal instruments of the state concerning springs were evaluated, resulting in the categorisation of the following types of engagement, which are assigned numerical codes (Table 1). **Table** **1****:** **Types of Engagements** | | | | --- | --- | | **Code** | **Engagements** | | 1 | Recognition of concerns about springs | | 2 | Laws for spring protection and management | | 3 | Ownership of springs for the individual, municipality, gram panchayat and the Water Users Associations, including private ownership | | 4 | Explicit protection plans for springs, such as recording of springs, catchment area protection and protection zones | | 5 | Public water systems managed by the Public Health and Engineering Department, the Irrigation Department, or the Municipality. | | 6 | Spring conservation in mining rules | | 7 | Hydropower and springs | Regionally, the Northeast exhibits the highest engagement (Table 2). West Bengal Hills also shows a high level of engagement. The Western Himalayan region, however, still has much to do. In terms of states, Mizoram leads the overall rankings with five kinds of engagement, followed by Meghalaya and West Bengal, which have four each. Sikkim, J&K, and Nagaland each have three. The others have two or fewer. It is worth noting that in some cases, a single legal instrument may have multiple engagements, and several legal instruments can share the same type of engagement, as explained below. **Table** **2****:** **Engagement Levels of States and Union Territories** | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | **Regions** | **States** | **Engagement Codes** | | Northeast | Arunachal Pradesh | 1,3 | | Assam | 3,4 | | Manipur | 5 | | Meghalaya | 1,3,4,5 | | Mizoram | 1,2,3,4,5 | | Nagaland | 2,3,4 | | Sikkim | 1,3,5 | | Tripura | 4,6 | | Western Himalaya | Himachal Pradesh | 2,7 | | Jammu & Kashmir | 2,4,5 | | Ladakh | 2,4,5 | | Uttarakhand | 2 | | Darjeeling and Kalimpong Districts | West Bengal | 3,4,5,6 | *[Green indicates the highest levels (four and above), Yellow indicates three and below]. Descriptive table in Annexure 2* **Northeast India – Making Significant Efforts** The NE region exhibits the most engagement with springs. Six out of eight NE states have clear plans for protection, making this the most common method of engaging with springs. This is followed by establishing ownership, which recognises Water User Associations, traditional institutions, and the state. The third most popular way of engaging with springs is harnessing them for public water systems. The range of engagement varies by state and is detailed below. *Recognition* – Mizoram focuses on springshed management using geology, hydrogeological, and conceptual mapping, followed by artificial rainwater harvesting. Meghalaya emphasises springs in water security, climate change, and resource efficiency, addressing them in planning, conservation, and use. Sikkim consolidates laws for forests, water courses, and springs, protecting them through legislation and project programs. *Laws for spring protection and management –* The NE states have implemented laws for spring protection and management through state or community bodies. They have also decentralised planning, allowing a bottom-up approach to developing state-level plans. Under the Mizoram Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Act 2024, springs are included, along with recharge, aquifers, and the Water Users Association, with a dedicated chapter on groundwater. The Government should develop an Integrated State Water Plan based on district-level water plans. The Nagaland Ground Water (Regulation and Control of Development and Management) Act, 2020, covers aquifers and springs, establishing the Nagaland Groundwater Authority. According to the Arunachal Pradesh Water Supply Act 2015, a water source is defined as “a spring, stream, river, pond (whether natural or not), or any other place where water is drawn for domestic or other purposes.” *Ownership of springs –* The laws also recognise ownership under traditional regimes or under the state bodies. For instance, Mizoram has Water User Associations. In Nagaland, village-level traditional institutions protect springs. Sikkim allows for the declaration of protected watershed areas, water sources, and main water routes. These protected watersheds and water sources then fall under the jurisdiction of the Buildings, Public Health and Engineering, and Housing Department. Using them requires permission from the relevant authority, which is granted upon payment of a tax. By contrast, the Meghalaya and Assam Municipal Acts bring all public springs under the jurisdiction of the municipality board. *Explicit protection plans for springs* – Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Meghalaya have developed various methods to safeguard springs. These include bringing springs under state control for conservation, banning construction, maintaining the springs, preventing pollution and waste disposal, declaring them as common property resources along with their associated ecosystems, declaring protection zones, and mapping springs and other plans for future work. The responsibility is mainly with the state or shifted to the owners of the springs. However, the communities that have primarily managed the springs should also be taken into consideration. These communities lack the resources to manage and protect themselves, especially in the face of uncertain changes, necessitating state intervention. State intervention should, however, not overrule existing systems but instead, ease their burdens. *Public water systems* – Mizoram authorises the department to develop public water systems in springs, including spring harvesting. No one, except for private water bodies, can object to this. Sikkim and Meghalaya recognise springs for waterworks. Manipur relies on springs for irrigation, water supply, and municipal waterworks properties in both rural and urban areas. *Spring conservation in mining rules* – Tripura requires lessees to obtain written permission from the District Magistrate & Collector/Director before using or impounding water from springs, ensuring that this does not compromise irrigation, livestock, or livelihood needs. They should also prevent polluting them. **Darjeeling and Kalimpong Districts in West Bengal – Some Milestones Achieved** West Bengal engages with springs in four ways: defining ownership, establishing protection plans, developing public water systems, and conserving springs in mining areas. However, there are no water or spring-focused legal instruments. The last legal instrument which included springs was in 2006. No recent legal instruments have been developed for springs. Details of existing instruments are outlined next. *Ownership of springs* – Ownership is assigned to either the municipality or the Gram Panchayat, depending on the region. Here, the power is vested in the Board of Councillors to set aside springs for drinking, bathing, washing, and culinary purposes. For rural areas, the Gram Panchayat has the authority to acquire, hold, and dispose of springs, as they serve as public channels. Akin to the case of the entire Himalayan region, here too, the communities manage the springs with minimal or negligible support from the government. The law has assigned responsibility to local bodies, but there has been no dedicated action on the ground yet. The prevalence of community-based systems is indicative of the government’s absence (Shah 2022). *Explicit protection plans for springs* – The protection rules are based on the Municipality and Panchayat acts, with no specific legal instruments focused on water. The West Bengal Municipal Act of 1993 mandates a proper assessment of springs used for drinking and cooking in municipal areas. The chairman of the municipal council requires owners of springs used by the public to maintain, keep clean, and protect them from pollution. This Act implicitly acknowledges private ownership of springs. Likewise, the West Bengal Panchayat Act of 1973 authorises the Gram Panchayat to exercise powers whereby the owner of springs utilised by the public must maintain, keep clean, and safeguard them from pollution concerning contaminated water supplies. *Public water systems* – The West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act, 2006, includes springs in its category of waterworks. *Spring conservation in mining rules* – West Bengal permits lessees of mining rights to use water from springs. However, they must not interfere with existing communities and livelihoods. They shall not alter the navigation flow or pollute the springs in any way. West Bengal, interestingly, has multiple legal instruments at the Municipality, Municipal Corporation, and Gram Panchayat levels. However, there is no matching groundwork being done under these bodies, except for springshed conservation using the Dhara Vikas Yojana concept that was originally launched in Sikkim. The translation of the state as the custodian of springs into effective conservation and management of springs is missing. Most of the support has been in rural areas. The West Bengal Ground Water Resources (Management, Control, and Regulation) Act, 2005, is intended to regulate the indiscriminate extraction of groundwater. The acknowledgement of springs and the need for their recognition and regulation is missing here. The Ground Water Yearbooks of West Bengal also fail to include springs in the 2018-2019 issue (Central Ground Water Board 2019; 2017; 2014). They have no technical assessments of springs, reiterating the exclusion of springs in groundwater studies. **Western Himalaya – An Opportunity for Engagement** J&K, situated in the Western Himalaya, recognises springs, has plans for their protection, and designates them for public water systems, making it the most active in spring management in the WH region. Himachal acknowledges the need for the security and management of springs under the Himachal Ground Water Act. Uttarakhand only recognises the importance of springs without any further engagement. This emphasises the potential to enhance involvement with springs across the WH. Details on the existing instruments follow. *Laws for spring protection and management* – Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh both mention springs as sources of groundwater. J&K recognises springs as a water source that requires protection and improvement. *Explicit protection plans for springs* – J&K established the State Water Resources Regulatory Regulations (2019) to define critical control point zones within a 200m radius of springs. These zones are intended to be protected and appropriately developed. *Public water systems* – J&K covers springs as part of its hydraulic works, and includes irrigation works within its scope. *Hydropower and Springs –* Himachal Pradesh is the only state with a Hydropower Cess that recognises springs as a source of water. All the WH states and UTs here have laws for protection, but only J&K has moved on to develop explicit protection plans and develop springs as a public water system. Uttarakhand and Himachal, meanwhile, have rich traditional and community-based water systems (Kelkar et al. 2008). However, they are neither part of nor recognised under any legal instruments. Springshed conservation using the concept of Dhara Vikas Yojana is being carried out here. Himachal Pradesh appears to be the only state in the entire Himalayan Region that has acknowledged the impacts of hydropower on springs and incorporated them into a legal instrument—something which all the Himalayan states and UTs must consider in the face of impending disasters. **Discussion** The Himalayan States and UTs have legal instruments, local customary laws, and community norms, which make it challenging to describe water rights and make it all-encompassing (Meinzen-dick and Nkonya 2007). The relationship between law and springs, along with their biophysical characteristics, makes it challenging to implement schemes like springshed management under Dhara Vikas Yojana, as most laws pertain to land boundaries and do not address groundwater. Hence, legal plurality should be at the heart of spring governance, where the state institutions, biophysical characteristics and customary laws interact (Boelens and Vos 2014). As a step towards understanding and enabling this, an assessment of the legal frameworks of the Himalayan State and UTs is crucial, as springs are owned and governed by different entities under various property regimes, including state, community, and private owners. It also demonstrates how the legal instruments of springs are not solely water-based but can also extend to other sectors, such as forestry, municipalities, gram panchayats, hydropower, and mining. Mizoram has led the way in defining spring governance through its laws with the latest Water Resources Act of 2024, which features a dedicated chapter on groundwater and advocates for a bottom-up approach to water planning, utilising district-level plans to develop its integrated state water plan. Its 2020 policy also includes springshed management as its key objective, which not only looks at springs but also their surrounding environment. Sikkim is the pioneer of the Dhara Vikas Yojana, despite lacking an explicit legal instrument for spring safeguarding. It is a strong example of the political will of the states, demonstrated not only through a legal mechanism but also through a significant public initiative. It is being replicated on a minor scale in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Nagaland, as well as in the villages of the Darjeeling Hills (Gupta and Kulkarni 2018). There may be a need to formalise this within a legal framework to ensure communities retain rights to resources for future generations. For planning mechanisms and statutory bodies, the biophysical aspects of springs and their governing institutions have been acknowledged in some cases. Almost all states and Union Territories (UTs) have explicit plans for protecting springs, with responsibilities assigned to private owners, Gram Panchayats, Municipalities, and Forest departments through: 1. Artificial groundwater recharge, 2. Prohibition of encroachment, 3. Penalties for disposing of waste into springs and their catchment areas, 4. Restrictions in catchment areas beyond the River Conservation Zone to maintain springs, streams, and rivers, 5. Classification of catchment areas as critical, sub-critical, or non-critical, 6. Prevention of filling any spring, 7. Mapping of springs and their catchments, 8. Establishment of an advisory board, 9. Forest protection to safeguard water sources, 10. Analysis of drinking water quality. Nearly half of the Himalayan states and UTs can utilise springs for public water systems, under state guidelines where the responsibility resides with the Public Health and Engineering Department, Irrigation Department, or the Municipality. They are permitted to establish infrastructure for waterworks and irrigation needs. Mizoram takes an additional step to dismiss any objections to the development of public water bodies by the Public Health and Engineering Department, apart from private water bodies. The existing legal instruments could serve as a blueprint for the Himalayan states and UTs to develop their spring governance, especially for states such as Assam, Tripura, and West Bengal, which are the only states without any water-focused instruments that engage with springs. Furthermore, in the case of Assam and West Bengal, there have been no legal acknowledgements of springs since 1956 and 2006, respectively. Manipur does not recognise concerns about springs or laws for their protection. This presents opportunities for these states and others not yet engaged with springs to learn from the experiences of those that are. Many existing instruments contain strengths that could be shared to help address the weaknesses of others. **Conclusion** All Himalayan States and UTs interact with springs in at least one way, using instruments that may or may not be dedicated to water. The strengths of the current instruments include recognising rights at all levels (individual, community, state, and public), with springshed management as the cornerstone, clear instructions for protection and sustainability, and anti-encroachment protocols for buildings and industries such as mining and hydropower. This variety of approaches demonstrates how every institution values springs in different ways. Some of them are present in overarching rules, while others are focused on specific programmes. As these are spread across various instruments and states, they can be adopted and updated where necessary. Sharing lessons within the region and across the Western Himalaya, Northeast, and Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts can yield significant benefits. The strengths of these programmes can be leveraged to address the weaknesses and the lack of well-defined property rights, thereby enabling more efficient water use and reducing inequitable access. More interdisciplinary studies on springs are imperative, as groundwater studies are expensive and still require further investigation. Due to the lack of state-led initiatives for managing and protecting springs, most work is carried out by entities and communities. In places where the drudgery related to water collection, acquisition, and low levels of water consumption already exists (Narain 2014), the lack of state support adds additional pressure on the communities to fend for themselves and preserve what little they have. There are areas where further enhancements could be implemented. * The possibility of private spring ownership could affect the public status of springs. This makes springs more vulnerable to privatisation, especially for profit, thereby impacting water availability and accessibility for communities. * There has been little initiative to recognise the existence of local and traditional spring-based supply systems. Due to the absence of state-led efforts to manage and protect springs, most work has been undertaken by entities and communities other than the state. However, only the state can manage the scaling up of such interventions. * The building and encroachment protocols can be extended to cover the effects of household-level pollution on spring water quality. * The impacts of industrial and commercial activities on springs, which are currently focused only on heavy industries like mining and hydropower in just three states, need to be expanded to include the impact of manufacturing and small-scale industries. **Annexures** **Annexure 1:** **Water-related Legal Instruments in Indian Himalayan States and Union Territories** 1.

In this regard I am currently writing a book provisionally titled *Escaping the Nation: India, Islam, and International Relations*. Via an analysis of Islam in India’s identity and foreign policy, the book demonstrates that ‘Muslimness’ in India’s international articulations often served as attempts to constitute an alternate form of sovereignty that escaped the bounds of the postcolonial nation state. My research also seeks to foreground caste in international relations and diplomacy. With my colleague Sruthi Muraleedharan I am co-editing a special issue on ‘The International in Ambedkar’ based on a workshop organised on the topic in November 2022. With Kalathmika Natarjan (University of Exeter) I am working on a project problematising the uncritical use of the term ‘pariah’ in international relations. In this regard we have recently submitted a co-authored paper titled *‘Pariah’ States and ‘Untouchable’ Subjects: Foregrounding Caste in International Relations* for a special issue on ‘Caste and Diplomacy’ for the Hague Journal of Diplomacy. * History and International Relations * Islam and IR * Caste and IR * Postcolonial and Decolonial Theory * Discourse Theory **Know More: [Click Here](https://research.snu.edu.in/researcher/medha)** ## Education * PhD ( Christian Albrecht Universität zu Kiel & GIGA German Institute for Global and Area Studies, Hamburg, Germany (awaiting) * MA Media Studies and Politics(specialization: war and conflict) Aarhus Universitet, Denmark and Swansea University, UK (with a semester at University of Amsterdam), 2010 * Post-Graduate Diploma inMass Communication**,** Symbiosis Institute of Mass Communication (SIMC), Pune, India, 2002 * BA (Special) English, Pune University, India, 2000 ## Work Experience * Research Fellow, German Institute of Global and Area Studies (GIGA), Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 2018-Aug. 2019 * Research Consultant, Robert Bosch Stiftung, Berlin, Germany, Nov. 2013-Jan.2014 * Research Associate, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA), New Delhi, India, Mar. 2012-Jul. 2013 * Reporter, The Vancouver Sun, Vancouver, Canada, Jun. 2011-Mar. 2012 * Assistant Producer/Reporter, Radio Netherlands Worldwide (RNW), Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Jul. 2009-Sep. 2009 * South Asian Fellow/Reporter, Deutsche Welle, Bonn, Germany, Jan. 2008-Jul. 2008 * Senior Copy Editor, The Times of India, Pune, India, Jan. 2006-Jun. 2007 ## Awards * Emerging Scholars Forum, Global Perspectives Journal 2019-2021 * Research Fellowship, Institute of Asia Studies, German Institute of Global and Area Studies 2019 * DAAD Graduate School Scholarship 2014-2019 * Erasmus Mundus Scholarship, European Commission 2008-2010 * South Asia Fellowship, Deutsche Welle, Bonn 2008 ## Journal Publications * Medha (forthcoming), Escaping the Nation: Abul Kalam Azad, Islam, and India’s Post-Independence Foreign Policy (1940-64).

My teaching and research are in sync. Over the years my research work has helped in publishing research papers as well as in formulating course-curriculum and research methodologies. From 2016-2019, I worked on a linguistic research project- ‘Language-Change in Newly Urbanized Places in NCR’. I teach "Mapping Language Change', a 400 level course, based on the methodology used in, and the conclusions derived from my linguistic research project on language change. I regularly work on different translation projects which help me update my translation course from time to time. I work with huge textual data. Digital tools have revolutionized the data analysis techniques. Indian languages don’t have many sophisticated, new-age digital tools. Fortunately, many Indian scholars have realized this need, and are creating digital linguistic tools for Indian languages. Since, I work with Hindi language, I have designed a multi-purpose Hindi text mining software- '*Shabdshilpi'*. This software hosts concordances, collocates, search engine and frequency generator for lexical clusters. The core of any digital linguistic tool is the lexical dataset of that particular language. Naturally, I have created a digital dictionary (*Akshara*) for my toolkit*.* It has approx. 80000 lexical entries. It is a work in progress. Another dimension of my research is to examine literary and critical practices of ancient Sanskrit texts. My current research project focuses on the concept of ‘*Shastrarth*’ in Sanskrit texts. **Know more: [Click here](https://research.snu.edu.in/admin/account/gatha-sharma)** ## Education 1995 B.A , M.D. University, Rohtak, Haryana, India. 1997 M.A (English Literature), M.D. University, Rohtak, Haryana, India. 2004 PhD (English Literature) M.D.S.

# 30 Years of Solvi-tude: Celebrating Prof. TSSRK Rao’s Research

![](images/banner_21-1.1600x0.webp) ## 30 Years of Solvi-tude: Celebrating Prof. TSSRK Rao’s Research How fast must the Earth spin for sunrise in New Delhi to be delayed by 2.5 hours compared to Jakarta? How long would the global economy withstand the Panama Canal running dry? What happens to time perception on a supersonic jet crossing time zones at breakneck speed? The world, in all its complexity, can often be distilled into mathematical functions—precise relationships between variables that shape reality as we know it. Prof. Taduri Srinivasa Siva Rama Krishna Rao, Head of the Department of Mathematics at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, has dedicated his career to unravelling these intricate relationships. 2025 marks his 30th year as a Professor of Mathematics.Better known as Prof. TSSRK Rao, he has published over 100 papers in functional analysis, a branch of mathematics that explores the nature of function spaces. A function space is defined as a set of functions between two fixed sets of variables. It is a type of vector space, which can be roughly understood as a mathematical set of objects (vectors) that are characterised by their dimensions in space (think of the x, y, and z-axes and any lines that can be expressed as a combination of these three variables). Functions and function spaces are used to describe a wide variety of phenomena across disciplines, from basic science to engineering and social sciences. Some commonly known applications includearrays in computer science, set theory, Newton’s law of cooling, asset pricing in economics, game theory, and Fourier analysis. One of the fundamental questions that arises while studying any phenomenon is how quickly itwould change if one of itscharacteristics was modified. “Most often, these kinds of ‘rates of changes’ can be formulated in terms of certain differential equations, and finding the solution would give you what kind of functions would satisfy the parameters you’re looking at. A lot of functional analysis tools are used in solving differential equations,”explains Prof. Rao. His work has also significantly advanced the understanding of Banach spaces, a cornerstone of modern mathematical analysis.Vector spaces come equipped with an additional structure, called a ‘norm,’ which is a way to quantify the magnitude of a vector. “Banach spaces are vector spaces where the norm is complete in a technical sense,” mentions Prof. Rao. “Most people are familiar with continuous functions on a closed and bounded interval—this actually forms a Banach space.”His research further explores areas such as L1-predual theory and Choquet theory, crucial for solving intricate mathematical problems with wide-ranging implications in science, engineering, and economics. Prof. Rao is a recipient of several prestigious honours, including two Fullbright–Nehru fellowships. He is also a fellow of both the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. He has served on the governing council of the Indian Statistical Institute for multiple terms, andis the Chief Editor of the Journal of the Ramanujan Mathematical Society.He is a member of the American and European Mathematical Societies, and has been an editor and reviewer for number of mathematical journals. Mathematics is often seen as an abstract pursuit, but its power lies in its ability to uncover patterns, predict outcomes, and solve real-world challenges. Prof. Rao’s 30-year journey is a testament to unwavering passion and intellectual curiosity. For researchers interested in the field, it is a reminder of how deep mathematical inquiry continues to shape our understanding of the universe. Here’s to celebrating Prof. TSSRK Rao’s remarkable contributions—and looking forward to the milestones yet to come. **This blog is written by Editage Digital Media Solutions, the research promotion division of Cactus Communications.** [Previous Article](/events/bringing-glaciers-to-new-delhis-attention-an-interdisciplinary-dialogue-on-the-himalayan-cryosphere/) [Next Article](/events/international-conference-on-wearable-and-emerging-bioelectronics-icweb/)

We are working on the following areas: Bacterial cell wall morphogenesis: One research area my lab is working on is cell division and morphogenesis of bacterial cell using Caulobacter crescentus as a model system. My broad research goal is to uncover the spatio-temporal regulation of cell wall synthesis in bacteria again better understanding of bacterial cell division. Bacterial Biofilms: Biofilms are known to mediate many diseases, as biofilms shield the bacteria from outside environment making it harder for antibiotics to kill bacterial cells. Our lab is studying the role of cell wall hydrolases in biofilm formation in pathogens such as, E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Microbial biodiversity and beneficial microbes: Currently, we are trying to understand and establish the bacterial communities present in aquatic and soil habitats. We are studying both synergistic and antagonistic microbial interactions in these communities in hope to develop new generation of antimicrobials.

My research has focused predominantly on the nineteenth century novel in England, especially the novels of Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray. I’ve written extensively on how a powerful strand within the 19th century novel veered away from the more literary forms of novel writing to draw its energies from the language of popular politics ; cartoons, urban prints, panoramas, stereoscopic entertainment, in short from what I call the London aesthetic. My essays on these topics have appeared in journals like *Representations , Victorian Studies, Nineteenth Century Literature* and *English Literary History* . My 2012 book *London, Radical Culture and the Making of the Dickensian Novel* ( Ohio State University Press) was nominated for the North American Victorian Studies Association prize. More recently I’ve worked on the complex ways medical knowledge in the 19th century mutated as it as it was drawn into the expressive economy of the novel and, in 2017 , I published a long essay on the subject in *Victorian Studies* . I became interested , too , in the early novel in India , and I wrote two essays on the 1861 Bengali text *Hootum Pyanchar Naksha*before collaborating with Baidik Bhattacharya on a collection of essays called *Novel Formations* brought out by Permanent Black in 2018. Shiv Nadar IOE gave me the mind space and time to begin a new chapter in life as a university teacher. In 2017 I published my first short story in *Wasafiri.* Another story of mine won an honorable mention in the “Family Matters” story competition run by the American magazine *Glimmer Train*. In 2021 I was awarded the prestigious Hawthorn Castle fellowship to complete a novel. My research has been supported by several international fellowships including the Foundation Fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, the Mellon Fellowship at the Huntington Library Pasadena, the Rockefeller Residency at Bellagio , the Leverhulme Fellowship at Anglia Ruskin University and the Institute of Advanced Studies Fellowship at Durham University . I was an invited speaker at the BBC book club event, curated by the iconic Harriet Gilbert to commemorate Charles Dickens’ bicentenary. I was also an invited respondent to Dame Gillian Beer’s post “Late Darwin and the Problem of the Human” which was part of the National Humanities Project “On the Human”. I serve as a member on the advisory board of *Victorian Studies*.

Statistical physics provides the framework relating microscopic to macroscopic properties. A fundamental assumption underlying this approach is that we have complete knowledge of the interactions between the microscopic entities. But what if that, even though possible in principle, becomes impossible in practice? Can we still construct a framework for describing their collective behavior? Dense suspensions and granular materials are two often quoted examples where we face this challenge. These are systems where because of the complicated surface properties of particles there is extreme sensitivity of the interactions to particle positions. In this talk, I will present a perspective based on notions of constraint satisfaction that provides a way forward. I will focus on our recent work on the emergence of elasticity in the absence of any broken symmetry, and sketch out other problems that can be addressed using this perspective. About the speaker: Bulbul Chakraborty is the Enid and Nate Ancell Professor of Physics and currently heads the Division of Science at Brandeis University. She completed her B.Sc. in Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur and her Ph.D. from Stony Brook University. After a postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory, she briefly returned to India but moved back to the U.S. an joined the Brandeis faculty in 1989, where she was the first woman physicist to be tenured there. She is an elected fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association of the Advancement of Science. She is the recipient of a Simons Fellowship in Theoretical Physics and a Distinguished Alumnus of IIT Kharagpur. Her current research centers on developing theories that describe the emergent properties of strongly interacting systems that are non-thermal. Examples include suspensions such as corn-starch, inks used in 3D printing, sand flowing in an hourglass and even sand dunes, where the common shared feature is their complex rheology: how they flow and jam in response to external driving. The challenge for a rigorous theoretical framework for these systems is the lack of conservation laws such as energy. Prof. Chakraborty has identified emergent conservation principles to construct field theories that describe the flow and rigidity of these unusual materials. A hallmark of her research is creating minimal theoretical models that focus on the underlying physics of messy, complex phenomena, identifying universal features. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/frontiers-at-the-femtoscale-science-and-techniques/) [Next Article](/events/fusion-on-earth-a-quintessentially-scientific-pursuit-with-an-important-commercial-goal/)

## Content
### Future Technologies in Design *Research on future technologies in design is an evolving and dynamic field that explores how emerging technologies will shape the future of design practices, industries, and user experiences. It explores the potential applications of emerging technologies to enhance the user-experiences, solve complex problems, and create innovative products for future. Researches also explore how such technologies can be integrated into the design process to create innovative products, services, and environments for future**.* One of the most promising areas of research in Design is to understand the role of future technologies (like Generative Design, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, IoT, 3D Printing and Additive Technologies, VR/AR/MR/XR, etc.) on the practice of Design and its applications in developing products and services for the people. Some of the key areas of Department’s interests are: * Virtual, Augmented, Mixed and Extended Reality (VR/AR/MR/XR) in Design: VR and AR technologies offer immersive and interactive design experiences. In design research, they can be used to create virtual prototypes, conduct user testing in simulated environments, and visualize designs in real-world contexts, providing valuable insights into user interactions and preferences. The MR and XR focus on designing for extended reality environments for future needs. * Gesture and Tangible Interfaces: Gesture and tangible interfaces are two innovative approaches to interacting with digital systems and devices, moving away from traditional input methods. Both interface paradigms focus on making interactions more intuitive, natural, and responsive, allowing users to engage with technology in a more tactile and expressive manner. These are valuable tools in design research, enabling researchers to explore new interaction paradigms, test user experiences, and gather valuable insights to inform the design of innovative products and user interfaces. They have great potential to develop new tangible interfaces in design such as interactive installations, product design, and novel user interfaces in MR & XR including other digital products. * Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in Design: AI and machine learning have the potential to revolutionize design research by automating various tasks, enhancing data analysis, and enabling personalized design experiences. AI-driven tools can assist designers in generating creative ideas, predicting user behaviour, and optimizing design solutions based on user feedback and preferences. * Generative Design: Generative design leverages algorithms and computational power to generate numerous design variations based on specified parameters and constraints. Designers can use this technology to explore a vast range of options quickly, leading to innovative solutions and optimized designs. * 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing: Investigating how 3D printing can revolutionize design by enabling rapid prototyping, customization, hybrid manufacturing and new material possibilities. Research in this area focuses on materials, processes, and applications across various design domains including smart products. * Robotics and Design Automation: Studying the integration of robotics and automation into the design process, enabling new possibilities in architecture, fabrication, and product design. * Bio-design and Bio-fabrication: Bio-design and bio-fabrication are emerging fields that explore the intersection of biology, design, and technology to create novel and sustainable solutions.

The public is aware of the intense competition between brands in different markets such as cola (Coke vs. Pepsi), mobile services (Jio vs. Airtel vs Vodafone), and automobiles (Honda vs. Toyota vs. Hyundai). The competition, however, goes beyond the brands in the same category. In fact, companies or brands from different categories compete, for example, for different markets, resources, customers, and channels. Business managers should not take a myopic view of competition being restricted to brands in a single domain. We will discuss the different bases of competition and illustrate how brands can successfully compete at different levels of competition. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-physics-organizes-a-seminar-on-modern-condensed-matter-physics-using-indigenous-instrumentation/) [Next Article](/events/biomimetic-total-synthesis-of-biologically-relevance-natural-products/)

## Content
### Sensory Worlds and Aesthetics Critical reflection on life and the lived world has always been the central concern of Sociology and Social Anthropology. However, increasingly, researchers are also investigating the ways in which this world becomes available in tangible and material ways. In our department, faculty and students engage with these questions by focusing on the mediation of the senses, especially the visual and the auditory senses for investigating the ways in which the sensorial world mediates our sense of the self and constructs the terms of the social in multiple ways. In this, aesthetics, in the sense of being a disposition to the senses, is an analytical category and/or a conceptual frame that becomes central to our contemporary sociological imagination. We, in the department, recognize the capacity of this conceptual frame to understand the unequal possibilities of developing sensibility in and of the social world/s we embody and encounter.

# More Than Just Literature: How English Powers Law, Media, and Global Culture ![A B.A. in English is more than just literature](images/b_a__engl_2_maining_f_gg.1600x0.webp) A B.A. in English is more than just literature Blog / August 28, 2025 [B.A. Research in English](/blogs/?tag=B.A. Research in English)[B.A. English](/blogs/?tag=B.A. English)[B.A. in English](/blogs/?tag=B.A. in English) The world consists of over 8.2 billion people who belong to different ethnicities and religions. What’s more fascinating is the fact that they speak over 7000 languages. People take great pride in speaking their languages, as there is a long history and cultural values associated with them. Out of all of those 7000s, one language that has established itself as a global means of communication is English, and its influence goes far beyond literature and novels. The adoption of English as a global medium of communication didn’t happen overnight, in fact there have been multiple factors including historical, political, economic, and cultural, that contributed to it. What’s more intriguing is the fact that in a linguistically-diverse country like India, where language changes with every region, English is used as a common language in the professional workspaces across science, corporate businesses, government offices, etc. Such evidence is enough to understand the kind of impact that English has on our daily lives. Therefore, it becomes important to study English deeply as it opens the gateway to diverse career opportunities. And the degree that serves the purpose is a **B.A. in English**. In this blog, we’ll see how English emerged as the lingua franca, along with the relevance of the degree in it for an individual in the long run. ## How English Rose as a Global Language English is used extensively across the globe as a common means of communication. Apart from the native speakers, people use English as their second and even third language. But the main question is “How did English emerge as the global language?” Well, the answer lies in the long history that primarily revolves around British colonial imperialism. The British colonial expansion during the 16th to 20th centuries is one of the major reasons behind English’s sheer dominance. There was a period when the British ruled over a quarter of the world’s population in the 19th century. Its consequences were reflected in administration, trade, law, and education, as they used English as the primary language in these areas. If we take India as an example, the British curbed down local languages at higher roles and prioritized English over them. And on August 15, 1947, when India got independence, the English language continued to rule the country's law and government system following its solid grounding. Furthermore, the Industrial revolution (during the 18th-19th century) and the rise of the United States (in the 20th century) played a massive role in spreading English in the global market as trade contracts, agreements, and communications relied heavily on it. In present times, over 1.5 billion people worldwide speak English, followed by Mandarin Chinese and Hindi. ## English’s Impact on Law, Media, and Global Culture In present times, around 186 countries speak English as a native or secondary language. It is enough to understand the huge impact of English across distinctive domains. The English dominance can also be witnessed from its use in the legal structure of different nations. Former British colonies like India, South Africa, and Singapore conduct their legal proceedings in English and also use it in the official documentation. ![English is the world's Lingua Franca](images/b_a__engl_2_infog.500x0-is-pid21033.png) English also rules the field of media and journalism as international news agencies, including BBC, CNN, Reuters etc., propagate information and news across the globe in English. The entertainment industry too produces the majority of its content in English in the form of shows, OTT, movies, songs, etc, which are widely consumed in non-English speaking nations. On a broader aspect, English influences global culture as it is used as the default language in science, business, and education. A recent report indicates that over 80% of the research papers are published in English, which reflects its widespread acceptance. ## Beyond Grammar - What a B.A. in English Really Unlocks Since we have already understood the prominence that English holds across different domains, it's time to draw our attention towards its study. **B.A. in English**, is an undergraduate program that emphasizes the study of English literature, language, as well as various areas related to it. A student who has just completed their 12th can pursue the degree and unlock a wide path of opportunities in: * Media and Journalism * Research and Academia * Writing and Publishing, and * Civil Services and Government Jobs Students also have the choice to pursue higher education to further elevate in their career. Here’s what you can do: * Bachelor of Education * Master's in English Literature * Master's in Creative Writing * Master's in Library Science * Master's in Journalism or Mass Communication ## Kick Start Your English Journey @Shiv Nadar University (Institution of Eminence) Selecting the right university is as important as selecting the course as it lays the foundation of a rewarding career in the long run. And if the course is B.A. in English where critical thinking plays a huge role, then choosing Shiv Nadar University becomes a no-brainer. Shiv Nadar University offers one of India’s most thoughtfully curated B.A. (Research) in English programs, which are rooted deeply in rigorous academics, global relevance, and logical freedom. The university integrates interdisciplinary freedom with research-led learning, offering a setting where literature meets various fields like cultural studies, creative writing, and media. The experienced and professional faculty at Shiv Nadar University make sure exceptional teaching methods help raise your learning experience to the next level. ## Conclusion - Why English is More Than Just Literature English language is not just an asset - it's a necessity. It serves as a bridge between people, cultures, and ideas. The modern times drive success via communication, and this is where English exhibits its power as a tool for overcoming obstacles and building connections. So, step into the world of English at Shiv Nadar University and study B.A. in English subjects that build different paths of opportunities. ## FAQs 1. **Does Shiv Nadar University conduct an entrance exam for B.A in English?** Yes.

# Microbes and Immunity | School of Natural Sciences

## Content
### Microbes and Immunity Research in this domain explores the complex interactions between microorganisms and the immune system, focusing on their roles in health and disease. Imbalances in microbial communities can lead to disorders and recent studies aim to leverage microbial metabolites and immune modulatory strategies to restore balance and develop therapies for a range of conditions. This multidisciplinary approach offers promising solutions for enhancing immune response and improving health outcomes. **Colin Jamora** The skin is the body’s largest and most external physical barrier, offering protection against harmful microorganisms, toxins, allergens, and extreme environmental factors. It also functions as an immunologically active organ, containing a range of immune effector molecules and resident cells from both the innate and adaptive immune systems, collectively forming a robust immunological barrier. Despite being constantly exposed to diverse microorganisms, the skin has an extraordinary ability to differentiate between harmless commensal microbes and harmful pathogens. Commensal microbes naturally inhabit the skin without causing harm and often provide benefits, such as preventing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. Conversely, pathogens take advantage of vulnerabilities like breaks in the skin barrier to invade and damage host tissues. The relationship between the skin's immune system and its microbiota is dynamic: the immune system can regulate microbial populations, while the microbiota plays a role in educating and shaping immune responses. When this balance is disrupted—a condition known as skin dysbiosis—it can lead to the onset of skin conditions such as acne, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis. Ultimately, the skin’s role as an immunological barrier is highly complex, relying on the interplay between its physical structure, immune mechanisms, and microbial ecosystem. This intricate coordination is essential for maintaining skin health and defending against harmful pathogens. **Highlights:** * Mechanisms by which the skin microbiota affect aging, immunity, and disease * Regulation of antimicrobial peptides in the skin to combat infection and promote skin homeostasis * Intercellular cross-talk between immune cells and other cutaneous cells * Novel functions of the innate and adaptive immune systems in tissue repair and regeneration ![](images/picture7.jpg) *As part of its innate immune system, the skin produces and stores a large reservoir of diverse antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with a wide spectrum of anti-viral and anti-bacterial activities. In addition these AMPs can regulate the adaptive immune system, thereby eliciting a comprehensive response to microbial infections. In collaboration with Unilever, the Jamora lab has been investigating the molecular mechanisms regulating the expression and secretion of AMPs from the skin in order to boost defense against potential infections. (Figure from DOI:* 10.1016/j.celrep.2019.10.090) **Webpage link:** <https://jamoralab.weebly.com> **Active Collaborations:** * Unilever * Koshkey Pvt. Ltd. **Relevant facilities:** * Centre for Integrative and Translational Research (CITRes) * Imaging facility * Sequencing facility **Richa Priyadarshini** Human microbiome has gained importance in the past decade and its role in health and diseases is well established. Oral microbiome is a highly complex microbial community residing in the oral cavity. More than 700 bacterial species are found in oral communities and is considered the second largest microbial community in the human body. Dysbiosis of these microbial communities leads to periodontal diseases such as periodontitis and dental caries. Lactobacilli are a part of the normal microbiota in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Lactobacillus species have been studied for a long time for their potential use as probiotics. Probiotic lactobacilli interact with other bacteria in the biofilm and hamper growth of pathogens through production of hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocins, and organic acids. While organic acids lower the pH, which promotes the growth of acid-tolerating bacteria, the production of bacteriocins may inhibit the growth of other pathogenic species. Apart from these lactobacillus species can also produce small organic metabolites which modulate the growth of bacterial biofilms. Our research involves isolation and characterization of small organic metabolites/peptides from Lactobacillus with anti-microbial properties. **Highlights:** * Creating a library of small organic metabolites/peptides produced from Lactobacillus species * Evaluation of antimicrobial properties of small effector molecules/peptides * Use of small metabolites/peptides to modulate biofilm mediated diseases * Understanding the underlying mechanism of antimicrobial effect **Funding:** SERB-YSS, ICMR, L’Oréal ![](images/picture8.jpg) Niranjan, R., Patil, S., Dubey, A., Lochab, B., & **Priyadarshini, R**. (2024). Biofilm, 8, 100237. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioflm.2024.100237 **Rajan Vyas** Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* (*M. tb*), primarily affecting the lungs, though it can spread to other parts of the body. TB is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can be fatal. The TB treatment is lengthy and typically involves a combination of four first-line drugs taken over six months. The patients must complete the entire course of treatment to eradicate the disease and avoid the origin of multiple drug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant (XDR) resistance strains, which require treatment involving second-line drugs for up to 18-24 months. Thus, there is a requirement to find novel drug candidates along with their inhibitors to help eradicate the MDR and XDR strains and reduce the length of the therapy. The essential *M. tb* proteins involved in its survival, pathogenesis, and virulence are potential drug targets and can be explored to discover new therapeutic drugs. Our research mainly focuses on biochemical and biophysical characterization of the essential proteins with the ultimate aim of identifying potential inhibitors using structure-based drug design that pave the way for novel drug development. **Highlights:** * Structural and functional characterization of clinically important proteins or essential metabolic pathway proteins using macromolecular protein crystallography. * Deducing mechanistic insights and identifying potential inhibitors as a structure-based drug-designing approach. ![](images/picture9.png) **Relevant facilities:** * Protein expression and purification facility * Protein analysis facility – Circular dichroism (CD) spectrophotometer, Microscale thermophoresis (*MST*) **Jugal Das** Cancer and autoimmune diseases represent extremes of immune dysfunction: cancer involves an immunosuppressive environment that allows tumor growth, while autoimmune diseases are driven by an overactive immune system causing chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Despite these differences, both conditions share regulatory pathways that offer potential therapeutic targets. Immunotherapy aims to restore immune balance by enhancing regulation in autoimmune diseases and overcoming suppression in cancer, such as targeting T cell populations to either control inflammation or reactivate immune surveillance against tumors. Advances in cancer immunotherapy have centered around approaches such as immune checkpoint inhibition, T cell expansion, and engineered T cell platforms, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Targeting major immune checkpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 axis or CTLA-4 has shown success in revitalizing T cells for robust anti-tumor responses. Complementary strategies focus on enhancing T cell infiltration into tumors and prolonging their functional activity in the tumor microenvironment. From the gut to the soil, microbes are silent partners in life’s grand design. An emerging aspect of research explores the use of microbes and their metabolites as immunomodulatory agents. This capability makes them valuable tools for both suppressing excessive inflammation in autoimmune disorders and enhancing immune activity in cancer. Understanding the intricate interplay between immune activation and suppression provides the foundation for innovative therapeutic strategies. The focus of the lab is to integrate conventional and novel immunomodulatory approaches, to develop balanced therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases aiming for translation. **Highlights:** * Cancer thrives in an **immunosuppressive** environment, while autoimmune diseases result from **hyperactive immunity**. * Both share **regulatory pathways**, offering therapeutic targets. * Cancer: **Boost T cell activity** to overcome suppression. * Autoimmunity: **Suppress excessive immune responses** to restore balance. * **Checkpoint inhibitors** reactivate T cells. * **CAR-T cells** and adoptive cell therapy strategies to **enhance T cell infiltration**. * Microbes and their metabolites **suppress inflammation** in autoimmunity and **enhance immunity** in cancer. **Lab Focus:** * Combining **traditional and novel approaches** to develop balanced **therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases**. * Developing **microbe based immunotherapeutic strategies** to balance immune responses to overcome autoimmune diseases and cancer. ![](images/picture10.604x0-is-pid20128.png) *Immune dysregulation in cancer and autoimmune diseases stems from T-cell imbalances. In cancer, T cells are suppressed, hindering tumor targeting, while in autoimmunity, overactive T cells cause tissue damage. T-cell therapies aim to restore balance: checkpoint inhibitors activate T cells against tumors, whereas autoimmune treatments suppress harmful T-cell activity. Microbes can modulate both these processes.* **Link to webpage:** <https://jk-impactlab.in/> **Active Collaborations:** Jianxun (Jim) Song, Endowed Professor in Immunology, Texas A&M University, USA **Relevant Facilities:** 1.

The Standard Model falls within the possibility of metastability, which means there can be a deeper minimum. Various beyond Standard-Model scenarios get bounds from the possibilities of vacuum instability or metastability. It has been seen that the extension of the SM with a scalar, in general, gives more stability to the vacuum, but the scalar quartic couplings get strong bounds from the perturbative unitarity. Different contributions with non-trivial gauge representation can tamper with the behaviour of the SM gauge couplings as well, which are also shown explicitly. Another fundamental question of our existence is called electroweak baryogenesis, which requires the first-order phase transition of the electroweak vacuum. The cubic term in the scalar potential is very crucial to achieving the first-order phase transition, which is generally not contributing enough in the SM and most of the minimal scenarios at the tree-level potential at zero temperature. However, finite temperature corrections can provide the much-needed cubic term. These strong first-order phase transitions can generate shock waves, popularly known as gravitational waves (GW), which can be detected by present and future experiments. All are cordially invited. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-mathematics-hosts-national-conference-on-operator-theory-and-function-spaces/) [Next Article](/events/chs-seminar-early-buddhist-figural-art-in-zangskar/)

There are many candidates that could account for dark matter; among the most prominent proposals are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs), and Primordial Black Holes (PBH). I will start by briefly outlining the case for dark matter and each of these proposed resolutions. Subsequently, I will discuss the idea that cosmology may give rise to appreciable populations of both particle dark matter (WIMPs/FIMPs) and PBH with the combined mass density providing the observationally inferred value of the dark matter abundance today. In particular, I will highlight that dark matter particles will generically form halos around the PBH leading to enhanced constraints on this scenario from indirect detection searches for dark matter. All are cordially invited. **Share this:**

The announcement of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) and its insertion into the Constitution and ideological framework of the Communist Party of China, was accompanied by a proclamation of the realization of the Chinese Dream in the 21st century. Under Xi Jinping, China has continued to champion the process of economic globalization for the world, even as it has also gone about clipping the wings of big private players in its economy. Post-COVID-19, President Xi Jinping decided to go beyond the realm of trade and economics in terms of China’s role in shaping the world order. His announcement of three global initiatives - developmental, security and civilizational - accompanied by a declaration of a vision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, can be considered as the most serious effort by China in the post-Mao era to claim a leadership role in the world. It is aimed at convincing the majority of the countries in the world that it is eminently feasible to have a harmonious existence with China as a global power. Xi Jinping is trying to portray a multi-civilization world order led by China, in contrast to the incumbent rules-based order, created and led by the Western countries, particularly the United States. It is imperative to examine the contours of Xi Jinping’s worldview as it has evolved over the past decade and its implications for the world order. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/inaugural-event-gender-and-stem-initiative/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-history-and-archaeology-and-max-weber-forum-for-south-asian-studies-organises-doctoral-research-workshop-on-global/)

### Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Ecology and evolutionary biology provide insights into how organisms interact with their environment and adapt to their surroundings over time. Studying the ecology and evolutionary adaptations not only enrich our basic understanding of various life processes but can also provide inspirations for novel biotechnological applications. The Ecology and Evolutionary Biology group at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence covers a wide spectrum of ecological and evolutionary research including speciation, adaptations, phylogenetics, developmental biology, sensory ecology, ecosystem functioning, biodiversity and biogeography. The biodiversity rich campus, with its lake and biodiversity park, provide natural ecological setups for teaching and research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In addition, facilities such as *Hydra* culture and transgenesis and insect rearing provide opportunities to controlled experiments. Advanced instrumentations and facilities, including high throughput Next Generation Sequencing chemistries and Proteomics, provide infrastructural support for answering complex questions at molecular level. In addition, state of the art computational facilities, including work stations, servers and software support, help in advanced computations and analysis. ![](images/artboard_1_1-1.jpg) **Dr. Neelesh Dahanukar** Assistant Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99f7fcfcf5fceaf1b7fdf8f1f8f7ecf2f8ebd9eaf7ecb7fcfdecb7f0f7) **Research focus** * Speciation on the drifting Indian subcontinent. * Genomic basis of evolutionary adaptations. * Multilevel selection of selfish genetic elements. ![](images/artboard_1_copy_1.jpg) **Dr. Richa Priyadarshini** Associate Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#394b505a515817494b5040585d584b4a51505750794a574c175c5d4c175057) **Research focus** * Cataloguing of bacterial biodiversity in Dadri Wetlands. * Whole genome sequencing of Novel Bacteria. * Harnessing biotechnological application of novel bacterial isolates. ![](images/artboard_1_copy_2_1.jpg) **Dr. Puli Chandramouli Reddy** Assistant Professor Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2353400d514647475a63504d560d4647560d4a4d) **Research focus** * Evolutionary Developmental Biology. * Evolutionary Genomics. * Ecological Developmental Biology. ![](images/artboard_1_copy_3_1.jpg) **Dr. Tanvi Deora** Faculty Fellow Department of Life Sciences [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2a5e4b445c43044e4f45584b6a59445f044f4e5f044344) **Research focus** * Comparative Biomechanics & Behavior. * Sensory Ecology. * Human impact on pollination. **Molecular ecology and evolution: adaptation, selection, and speciation** **PI: Neelesh Dahanukar** ![](images/picture2m.775x0-is-pid20124.jpg) Molecular phylogeny, molecular dating and historical biogeography of Western Ghats stone loach *Bhavania* spp. Indian subcontinent has experienced a fascinating tectonic history in the last hundred million years when it left Gondwana and drifted towards Eurasia. This journey of the Indian subcontinent is marked with several geoclimatic activities that have influenced the diversity of endemic fauna and flora of this region. We specifically work on freshwater fishes as they have low dispersal abilities and provide fine scale information on how geoclimatic events might have influenced speciation on drifting Indian subcontinent. Our large scale molecular phylogenetic studies of freshwater fishes have revealed that the journey of Indian subcontinent was much more eventful than previously thought and requires proposing and testing multiple alternate hypothesis to understand the original of diversification of India freshwater fishes. Our work on reconstructing ancestral states in phylogenies have not only led to discoveries of multiple endemic taxa and adaptive radiations, but have also unveiled how tectonic activities, geological events, ancient river captures and paleoclimate have shaped biological evolution on the Indian subcontinent. Our explorations have also uncovered evolutionarily unique lineages that occupy extreme environmental conditions, for instance hill stream rapids and subterranean channels, which have led to several physiological and anatomical adaptations in these organisms. We study the genomic basis of these evolutionary adaptation by whole genome sequencing and genome wide selection analysis. In addition, we employ mathematical framework of multilevel selection and game theory to understand evolution of selfish genetic elements and its effect on genomic integrity. **Research focus:** 1. **Speciation on the drifting Indian subcontinent:** Reconstruction of biogeographical history of India using multigene phylogeny of freshwater fishes to understand how paleoclimate and tectonic activities contributed to various cladogenetic events and speciation. 2. **Genomic basis of evolutionary adaptations:** Understanding the genomic basis of evolutionary adaptations to extreme environments and unique niches. 3. **Multilevel selection of selfish genetic elements:** Understanding evolution of selfish genetic elements like transposons using evolutionary game theory. **Homepage:** <https://sites.google.com/snu.edu.in/molecoevo> **Harnessing Microbial Biodiversity for Biotechnological Purposes** **PI: Richa Priyadarshini** ![](images/picture3r.728x0-is-pid20124.jpg) Studies on *Deinococcus indicus* DR1 and *Exiguobacterium undae* DR14. (A) FM4-64 and DAPI staining showed daughter cell attachment at division sites in *Deinococcus indicus* DR1. (B) Atomic force microscopic images showing degradation of Polystyrene by *Exiguobacterium undae* DR14. Wetlands, defined as land areas that are saturated with water – either permanently or seasonally – are rich ecosystems supporting a wide array of flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity of wetlands has attracted attention due to the high number of species present in the small geographical area. Bacterial diversity in wetland ecosystems is estimated to be an amalgamation between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Metagenomics and synthetic biology advancements have paved the way for utilizing microbial diversity for tailored applications. Harnessing microbial biodiversity supports sustainable development by reducing environmental impact and promoting circular bioeconomy principles. One of the primary goals of our research is to isolate and characterize microbes with biotechnological potential from wetlands. We studied the cultivable bacterial communities residing in the wetland of Dadri, Uttar Pradesh, India. Our laboratory has isolated more than 100 bacterial species from the wetland soil and water samples. After primary characterization, bacteria showing unique characteristics were studied in detail. We focused on the following bacterial species- *Deinococcus indicus*strain DR1*, Exiguobacterium sibiricum* strain DR11*, Exiguobacterium undae* strain DR14*.* *Exiguobacterium* strains DR11 and DR14 can potentially degrade plastic, especially polystyrene. Exiguobacterium species are known to be extremophiles and can utilize polystyrene as a carbon source. *Deinococcus indicus*strain DR1 is a red-pigmented, arsenic-resistant bacterium. **Funding:** DBT, Earthwatch India **Research focus:** 1.

I am particularly interested in the molecular innovations that enabled cells to stay together after cell divisions, differentiate into specialized types (such as neurons and muscle cells), form distinct germ layers, establish diverse body plans, and develop precise body axes and sizes. To explore these fundamental processes, I use *Hydra*, an early eumetazoan, as a model system. **Research focus:** 1. **Evolutionary Developmental Biology:** Investigating how developmental signaling pathways evolved to regulate chromatin dynamics in the process of axis patterning, and the emergence of novel cell types in *Hydra*. 2. **Evolutionary Genomics:** Using comparative genomics to identify key genomic transitions that contributed to lineage-specific innovations. 3. **Ecological Developmental Biology:** Exploring the roles of microbial and abiotic environment in epigenetic regulation and developmental processes in *Hydra*. **Homepage:** <https://sites.google.com/snu.edu.in/coee/groups> **Sensory Ecology of Insect Pollination** **PI: Tanvi Deora** We study the biomechanics and sensorimotor mechanisms of insect behaviors. Insects are the major pollinators of flowering plants. How insects find and feed from flowers has a profound influence on their ability to pollinate plants. Insects use various sensory modalities such as olfaction, vision, touch, humidity etc to locate their host flower and find the tiny nectary to feed from them. Some like the nocturnal hawkmoths hover while feeding, and perform these functions even at dawn and dusk when light levels are limited. Feedback from several sensory modalities help control and coordinate body and appendage motion. In the lab, we ask how biomechanics and neural dynamics have shaped such ecological interactions. We combine behavioral, neuroanatomical, biomechanical and electrophysiological techniques to investigate how these insects use their sensors to perform rapid and precise tasks. Using comparative approaches, we study how evolutionary history and ecology have shaped neural systems and body mechanics. In addition to bringing these behaviors to the lab, we also study the impact of sensory ecology and learning in insects on the pollination efficiency in the field. ![](images/picture5_1.750x0-is-pid20124.jpg) Studies exploring impact of environmental factors such as light pollution on campus and Surajpur wetlands.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of promising antibiotics against drug-resistant bacteria [2]. As the main target of AMPs is the bacterial membrane, a detailed study on the interaction between AMPs and lipid membrane is required to understand their action mechanism. In this talk, I will focus on the physics of interaction of different AMPs with model biomembrane systems as investigated using neutron scattering techniques [3-8]. The interaction of AMPs is found to be strongly dependent on the physical state and composition of the membranes [6-8]. Another notable observation is the lateral segregation of lipids in the membrane elicited by the reduced lateral mobility in presence of AMP [7]. Our studies divulge a new action mechanism of AMPs relevant in a more realistic scenario, where peptide concentration is not as high as would be required for pore formation, a traditional action mechanism [6,7]. We have also shown that AMPs selectively interact with the model bacterial membrane [8]. Interaction of other potential antimicrobial agents (ionic liquids, curcumin, etc.) with lipid membrane [9-11] will also be discussed briefly in this talk. **References** 1. D. G. J.

# Electrochemical Energy Research | Department of Chemistry | School of Natural Sciences

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-natural-sciences/research/electrochemical-energy-research/

## Content
Research Project ### Electrochemical Energy Research Despite the great potential of electrochemical energy devices (fuel cells, electrolyzers, rechargeable metal-air batteries, etc.), the high cost, lowperformance, and poor durability of the catalyst-coated electrodes under the operating conditions have precluded their overall efficiency. In most electrochemical energy devices (EEDs), approximately 70-80% cost is contributed from the catalyst-supported electrode part alone. Therefore, to bring the EEDs to the competitive level of conventional energy technologies (internal combustion engines), it is necessary to reduce the cost of catalyst-coated electrodes with increased efficiency/durability. Thus, the ultimate goal of this research group is to address these issues and to provide pollution-free energy by developing next-generation high-performance materials and their utilization in the fabrication of the device. The impact of the activities will be directly on the economic and technological progress along with the fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes. Focus areas: * Fundamental electrochemistry and mechanistic studies * High-performance electrocatalytic materials development * Electrode designing for the various catalytic process (ORR, OER, HER, CO2RR, N2RR, etc.) * Fabrication of next-generation electrochemical energy devices (fuel cells, water electrolyzers, flexible supercapacitors, etc.)

![Research](images/research_bg.1600x0.webp) # Research Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence is a research university, in that, academic research in its broadest meaning including basic and applied research, scholarly publications, and creative expression, are the fundamental building blocks of the academic mission of the University. We believe strongly in the role of the University as a center for the discovery and creation of new forms of knowledge and expression, and in a mission to contribute to the process of creating knowledge, not just disseminating it. The University’s goal is to become nationally and internationally recognized for the quality of our research and creative endeavors, and their applicability to improving quality of life, generating new insights, and expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and creativity. ![University-wide Research Priorities](images/revised.345x200.1600x0.webp) ### University-wide Research Priorities In 2021, we undertook an extensive exercise which we called 'Quo Vadis'. Four priority researches were identified by the university community: Environment, Energy, Cognition and behavior, and Data and computation. [![Research Excellence Initiatives](images/image_75.345x200.1600x0.webp)](https://snu.edu.in/research/research-excellence-initiatives/) ### [Research Excellence Initiatives](https://snu.edu.in/research/research-excellence-initiatives/) The University offers help in various funding vistas in India and abroad.

The synergy between teaching and research is the stronghold, rooted in the belief and efforts towards creation of knowledge (by researching) and not just disseminating it (by teaching). [Learn More](https://snu.edu.in/research/research-resources-and-compliance/) A message # From the Dean's Desk ![dr_-suneet-tuli-th](images/dr_-suneet-tuli-th.jpeg) **Dr. Suneet Tuli** Dean, Research & Partnerships **Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence** B.E. (Honors), Electrical & Electronics, BITS Pilani M.Tech., Electronics, IIT Delhi Ph.D., Electronics, IIT Delhi “Research, with its many facets, is the driver of vibrant human progress. At the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, our vision is to create new knowledge and undertake creative expressions of the human spirit. Though we are a multidisciplinary research-focused university, academically organised around four distinct schools, we also lay strong emphasis on interdisciplinarity for quality research.” Active and meaningful collaborations are the keys to research successes in today's strongly connected world. At SNIoE, a combined Research and Partnerships in one office, underlines the importance we place on collaborations as a key enabler. These could be academic, industrial, societal, national, and/or international. The Research and Partnerships office also lays great emphasis on promoting collaborations within the University. Stepping into our second decade, recognized as an Institution of Eminence, we have held university-wide discussions to collectively identify the focus of future research. This has resulted in the emergence of common research themes across all Schools. * Environment * Cognition & Behavior * Data & Computation and * Energy Other identified interschool themes for engagement include Materials, Computational Science and Engineering, Biology, Emerging Economies, Entrepreneurial Leadership, Digital Transformation, Analytics, and Organizational Performance. There exists a strong supporting ecosystem, including state-of-the-art laboratory spaces, post-doctoral fellows and research scholars, research promotion through start-up/seed funds, professional development assistance, consumable grants, fellowships to research scholars, travel support, etc. Around 30 MoUs with reputed institutions of the world provide for meaningful collaborations and building relationships to enhance research capabilities.

There is a growing demand for Design undergraduates in India and abroad, so much so that it has become one of the most sought career paths in recent years. The Indian design sector is growing at 23%-25% annually and is further expected to accelerate by integrating design curriculum with school education. The Department of Design undertook a year-long extensive and intensive consultation process to understand the changing landscape of Design in the 21st Century. It involved several prominent Indian and global Design experts & visionaries both from academia and industry. The Bachelor of Design (B. Des.) program at Shiv Nadar IoE assimilates all the wisdom and insights gained from the process. The key highlights of the program make it stand out compared to other such programs offered in the country. **Focus on Human-Centered Design (HCD):** Human-Centered approach to Design elucidates that the program is focused on designing for people and society. This approach allows designers to co-create better solutions by considering people’s needs not as individuals but as societies with complex, systemic problems. **Future-Oriented Curriculum:** Designers in the 21st Century are entrusted with increasingly complex and impactful challenges. These challenges require future-oriented courses (like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Virtual and Augmented Reality, etc.) and a set of future core competencies (like co-creation). **Integration of 3DEXPERIENCE platform from Dassault Systèmes**: Shiv Nadar IoE is home to an advanced and futuristic software platform from Dassault System that is integrated into design courses and projects of the B. Des. program. This is particularly very useful for students of the Product-System design stream. **Choice-based Streaming and Specialisation Options**: The program allows students to pursue their desired streams (for B. Des. Degree), and specialisations (for Integrated B.Des. – M. Des. Degree) by selecting from a range of elective courses. **Vibrant and Multidisciplinary Ecosystem:** Design programs relevant to the 21st Century must be centred on human well-being and quality-of-life issues, which must draw on the entire range of human knowledge and wisdom. The vibrant and multidisciplinary ecosystem of CCC (Common Core Curriculum) and UWE (University Wide Electives) courses links students with sciences, arts, and technologies available on its campus and through SNIoE networks. **Low Faculty-Student Ratio**: We offer an exemplary learning environment built on a close interaction between those who teach and those who learn. Our approach respects the understanding of design education as mutual learning and of the apprentice-mentor relationship and proximity to the real world of service that once gave Indian design education the strength to emerge as a global model. B. Des. program prepares students for design practice in Industry where they are required to take multiple roles but excel in any one domain. To support this requirement, choice-based streaming options are available where a student may choose elective courses from the following domains of Design: 1. Experience Design (UX/UI): The stream offers courses for the 21st Century that consist of a variety of courses like user experience design, IoT, interface design, information design, intangible interfaces, 3D modelling for virtual reality and augmented reality. The stream aims to train the students with a skill set of industry and future-oriented careers. 2. Product – System Design: A product is not only an artefact in isolation but emerges as part of a system, culture, or environment. Product – System Design stream offers courses that enable students to take the system thinking approach to design and develop products which always appear as a part of the system or environment. Few of the courses in this stream are Smart Product Design, tangible interfaces, Mobility Design and system approach to product development. 3. Visual Communication Design: The courses of the stream enable students to equip themselves with a set of skills to emerge as a communication designer with the understanding of visuals – their meaning and role in various communication mediums. This practice-oriented stream offers courses like interface design, campaign design, packaging design and animation. ## Program Brochure [Download](/site/assets/files/10587/two_page_a4_flyer_for_b_des_1_6a_copy_compressed.pdf) [Visit Us](https://snu.edu.in/admissions/#come-visit-us) [View Programs](/programs/) [Study At Shiv Nadar](https://snu.edu.in/academics/) [Apply Here](https://snuadmissions.com/) [Work With Us](https://snu.edu.in/work-with-us/) [Recruit Graduates](https://snu.edu.in/work-with-us/)

As private interests enter the picture, the tendency is to think that the "problem" has been reduced to a technical one requiring only engineering solutions. While engineering is highly challenging, CVF will continue to remain a fundamental scientific pursuit. While the goals can be societal and commercial, the pathway to getting there must be led by physics. We will explore the current vast fusion landscape and make a case why new physics will be crucial to make fusion energy affordable. **Share this:**

## Faculty at School of Humanities and Social Sciences ![Vinayak Das Gupta](images/profile_1.1600x0.webp) # Vinayak Das Gupta Associate Professor School of Humanities and Social Sciences ##### Contact Information * Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ff9e6e1eef6eee4a1ebeefce8fafffbeecffce1faa1eaebfaa1e6e1) ## Research Interest My research engages with the ways in which technologies, especially those concerned with language, memory, and classification, mediate the human experience of history. I work across digital humanities, public memory, and archival theory, with a particular emphasis on infrastructures. These may be technical infrastructures (algorithms, platforms), institutional infrastructures (evaluation systems, grant protocols), or affective infrastructures (care, belief, habit). One strand of my work investigates how computational models of language, such as topic modelling, can be made intelligible in low-resource languages like Bengali. I am interested in interpretability, not simply as a technical challenge but as a philosophical and pedagogical one. How do we make pattern-seeking systems legible to those unfamiliar with statistical reasoning? What forms of visualisation can support critical reading rather than obscure it? Another strand focuses on digital curation and public history. I have been involved in the design and development of online archives, most notably *Recalling Jewish Calcutta*, and continue to reflect on the ethical and infrastructural dimensions of building public memory online. My collaborative work on *Letters of 1916* explored how historical correspondence can be made visible through experimental visualisation and geospatial tools. Many of these projects were explicitly participatory, involving public contributors and community members in the act of annotation and curation, thus reframing the archive as a shared, rather than sealed, space. I also write on material culture and photography, with a focus on the fragmentary life of images and the interpretive challenges they pose. My work has examined colonial-era photographs as synecdochic objects: images that gesture toward absence, rupture, and the impossibility of complete recovery. I reflect on the curatorial possibilities of thematic arrangement in the face of archival loss. I have explored how mismatched captions, incomplete metadata, and handwritten annotations complicate the legibility of family photographs and private albums. Across these essays, I attend to the tactile, visual, and mnemonic dimensions of photographic materials, and the ways in which they persist as anchors of memory even when severed from their original contexts. Across all these domains, my research is guided by a concern with care: how knowledge is held, transmitted, and transformed across systems that are often fragile or incomplete. ## Education * **PhD in Digital Humanities**, Trinity College Dublin *Thesis: From Evidence to Essence: Curating Thematic Collections with Photographs from the British Raj* * **MA in English Literature**, Jadavpur University * **BA (Hons.) in English Literature**, Jadavpur University ## Work Experience 02/17 08/17 Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Maynooth University, Ireland 02/16 02/17 Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Maynooth University, Ireland 10/15 02/16 Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Maynooth University, Ireland 03/11 07/11 Project Fellow, Jadavpur University, Calcutta ## Awards * TEI-C Research Grant, 2018 * Postdoctoral Research Award, DARIAH-EU, 2017 * Open Education Grant, DARIAH-EU, 2017 * Nominee, Paul Fortier Prize, Alliance of Digital Humanities Organisations, 2016 * Postdoctoral Research Award, Digital Repository of Ireland, 2015 * Digital Arts and Humanities Scholarship, Higher Education Authority of Ireland, 2011 ## Publications * Das Gupta, Vinayak. ‘Memories and Mixed Media: the Event and the Archive.’ *Cinema and the Indian National Emergency*, eds.

Still, it is crucial to nurture the innovative mindset at the state level and embrace entrepreneurship across the length and breadth of the country. Mr. Iyer remarked, “The power of technology and the Atal Incubation Mission’s initiatives towards innovation has scaled up the role that Atal Incubation Centre plays today. And I believe that Mission is a fabulous collaboration with Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR.” In his address, Chancellor Shikhar Malhotra encouraged emerging entrepreneurial mindsets and thanked Mr. Parameswaran Iyer for supporting efforts toward fostering startups at the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi-NCR. Throwing light on the importance of education in one’s development and growth, Chancellor Malhotra rightly observed that it takes centuries for an institution to become world-class – an average of 120 years. He pondered whether any of us would witness the youngest Institution of Eminence achieve its maximum potential, but what matters is that we are significantly growing year after year. The Guest of Honour, Mr. Deepak Bagla, Managing Director, Invest India, Government of India highlighted that India is currently going through the most unprecedented transformation in human evolution due to innovation. Addressing the audience, he shared, “Today, we have startups registered from 680 districts across India, and the new growth engine of India is in each and every village. Innovation is driving growth – for the first time, a startup has gained 100 million customers in just 180 days.” In her address, Dr. Ananya Mukherjee, Vice Chancellor, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi- NCR, emphasized that the goal of the Atal Incubation Centre at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi- NCR is to act as a catalyst in enabling the promising startups establish themselves and scale up. The Vice Chancellor remarked, “The AIC is a tech-agnostic incubator where we have sensitized 2000+ young minds, supported 64+ startups, and have helped startups raise over six crores. With world-class facilities, including 154+ labs, and stimulating research centres, we will continue to support promising entrepreneurs by giving them a well-grounded foundation in the entrepreneurial way of life.

The talk will be delivered by **Dr. Tarit Roychowdhury**, School of Environmental Studies, Jadavpur University, Kolkata. Natural groundwater arsenic contamination and the resulting toxic effects have become one of the staggering challenges to human health in modern times, with large parts of the Ganga-Meghna-Brahmaputra plain of India with an area of 569,749 km2 and population over 500 million has been exposed to this devastating calamity. The calamity in these places, particularly in Bengal delta, with over 100 million people living in zones has assumed gargantuan proportions as arsenic levels in drinking water has overshot far above the guidelines set by World Health Organization at 10 μg/L. Arsenic concentration in groundwater initially increases up to a certain depth (approximately 40 m below ground level), then decreases with increase of depth. Moreover, arsenic concentrations in many tube wells had been increased 5-20 folds within a span of 3-7 years. The presence of deep tube well in the rural areas has somewhat ensured the arsenic-contamination problem in groundwater, but it varies on hydro-geographical conditions. Furthermore, what is worrisome is that arsenic-contaminated groundwater is increasingly being used to irrigate the fields. Thus, arsenic has begun to seep into crops and food chain which could trigger a large scale environmental tragedy, fatally affecting future generations. Arsenic is a naturally occurring element and arsenic levels in foods generally reflect its natural accumulation from the environment. It is very common knowledge that the arsenic-contaminated groundwater, which is mainly used for drinking, is a major route of arsenic exposure but when the same water is being used for agricultural purposes, mainly for the ‘boro’ cultivation of paddy, the problem of arsenic accumulation aggravates. Arsenic accumulation in paddy plants at different phases of pre-monsoon cultivation has been further extensively studied. Arsenic is translocated from root to aerial parts in descending order. Leaf, stem, root, root soil and surface soil showed a similar trend in their change of arsenic concentration throughout the cultivation period. Arsenic concentration was highest in vegetative phase; sharply declined in reproductive phase; followed by moderate increase in ripening phase. Thus, soil arsenic concentration increases in the final phase of cultivation which in turn contributes to increased concentration in plant parts. However, during monsoonal cultivation, the synergistic effect of groundwater and rainwater makes a diffused approach to the nature of arsenic flow in plants, which provides least arsenic enriched grain irrespective of the variety of cultivar and area of cultivation, compared to the pre-monsoonal grain and much safer for consumption with respect to arsenic. Mitigation technologies need to be addressed for reduction of arsenic in soil-plant system to restrict its entry in rice grain. Use of synthesized nanoparticle(s) like Fe-and Si-nanoparticles and other agrochemicals (organic and minerals) in soil can be experimented to reduce the arsenic flow from root to shoot and investigate the effect on antioxidant activities under arsenic stress condition in paddy and other vegetable plants. Hydro-priming of rice seed with potassium humate for germination enhancement, seedling growth promotion and better antioxidant defense system under arsenic stress can be investigated. The overall goal is to address the problem of arsenic contamination in food chain, especially the rice grain which is a staple food suggesting a plausible guideline in preparing management mitigation plan, which could be adaptive for the society. **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/leadership-series-deans-dais-nature-and-nurture-how-environment-shapes-our-genes/) [Next Article](/events/talked-by-tulasi-srinivas-the-missing-goddess-women-water-and-life-in-urban-area/)

![...](images/banner_image_commentary_2_1_45.1600x0.webp) 9 October 2025 # Dams in the Discourse of Development: Vulnerabilities and Systematic Barriers to Communities-Inclusive Policies in Arunachal Pradesh [Amrita Saikia](/centres/centre-of-excellence-for-himalayan-studies/research/?author=21362) In mid-2025, reports appeared about the resumption of stalled hydroelectric projects, including the controversial 3,097 MW Etalin hydroelectric project (HEP), in the Dibang valley of Arunachal Pradesh. On July 30, 2025, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) for River Valley and Hydroelectric Power Projects, Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India, [recommended the environmental clearance](https://www.projectstoday.com/News/Etalin-hydropower-project-in-Arunachal-gets-recommended-for-environmental-clearance) for the Etalin HEP. The project is a run-of-river scheme, which aims to construct two dams on the Dri and Talo (Tangon) tributaries of the Dibang river on an area of [1175.03 hectares](https://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Form-1A/Minutes/1108202529836233MoM_36th_EAC_RVHEP_30_07_2025.pdf) and an [underground powerhouse complex](https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2025/04/12/sjvn-releases-rs-269-98-cr-land-compensation-for-etalin-hep/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) near Etalin village in the sub-districts of Anini and Etalin in the Upper Dibang valley district of Arunachal Pradesh. The Etalin HEP was initially conceived by the Central Electric Authority. In [2008](https://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/Form-1A/Minutes/1108202529836233MoM_36th_EAC_RVHEP_30_07_2025.pdf), the government of Arunachal Pradesh had allotted the project to Etalin Hydroelectric Power Company Ltd. and Jindal Power Ltd. However, the project was significantly delayed because local communities and environmentalists, conservationists, and social activists raised serious environmental and social concerns regarding the project. Anti-dam protests against the Etalin HEP peaked between 2008 and 2013. These anti-dam discourses were grounded on severe dam-related adversities that people could face, such as the adverse impacts on people’s livelihood, cultivable land, forest products, traditional lifestyles, aquatic ecosystem, forced displacement, and resettlement. In 2020, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) conducted a biodiversity assessment of the Etalin HEP in response to the Forest Advisory Committee’s (FAC), a statutory body under MoEFCC, recommendation. Scientists and researchers from 14 institutions who [reviewed](https://zoosprint.org/index.php/zp/article/view/5686) the technical report prepared by WII based on the assessment raised several concerns. They argued that there “appeared to be an underplay of the negative impacts of the Etalin HEP throughout the (WII) report.” However, based on the WII report, the FAC only raised questions regarding the project’s economic viability and neither “recommended” nor “deferred” the [project](https://india.mongabay.com/2020/05/etalin-hydel-plants-future-now-hangs-on-its-economic-viability/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20minutes%20of,be%20accepted%20by%20the%20FAC.). Furthermore, the FAC dismissed the concerns raised by experts regarding threats to biodiversity. Meanwhile, as the government pushed for the projects and assured the communities that the projects would not be rolled out without addressing the concerns of the local people, the dissenting voices [gradually](https://scroll.in/article/1027660/no-more-dams-a-protest-message-painted-on-a-wall-is-making-the-arunachal-government-see-red) dissipated. As per reports, the consent for the dams in Dibang valley were “[manufactured by terrorising the people of Arunachal Pradesh](https://scroll.in/article/931504/how-consent-for-dibang-dam-was-manufactured-by-terrorising-the-people-of-arunachal-pradesh).” In 2022, two activists—one from Arunachal Pradesh and another from Assam—were arrested for displaying resistance against the Etalin HEP through [“graffiti” in Itanagar](https://scroll.in/article/1027660/no-more-dams-a-protest-message-painted-on-a-wall-is-making-the-arunachal-government-see-red), but they were released on bail after two days. In 2023, the FAC’s [decision to reject](https://india.mongabay.com/2023/02/denial-of-clearance-to-etalin-hydel-project-offers-relief-to-some-may-impact-arunachals-hydropower-development-plan/) the Stage II or [final forest clearance](https://india.mongabay.com/2023/02/denial-of-clearance-to-etalin-hydel-project-offers-relief-to-some-may-impact-arunachals-hydropower-development-plan/) of the Etalin HEP, which would require felling more than [278,038 trees](https://forestsclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/RO_Siteinspection/0_0_08_Apr_2020_115021200_mon_siteinspectionreport.pdf), brought a ray of hope and temporary relief to those concerned about the negative environmental impacts of the project. However, despite the protests and concerns, in 2023, the government of Arunachal Pradesh entrusted the work of constructing the Etalin HEP to Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SVJNL), a public-sector enterprise. Following this, the Project Affected People Forum (PAPF) of Arunachal Pradesh demanded immediate disbursement of compensation to the people facing involuntary displacement, urged the governments at the centre and the state to resolve the pending cases of “compensatory afforestation,” and warned that if their demands were not met they would resort to [democratic resistance](https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2024/06/22/etalin-hep-papf-demands-disbursement-of-pending-compensation/). In April 2025, the SVJNL, which signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Arunachal Pradesh to construct the Etalin HEP and other projects, released ₹269.98 crores as land [compensation](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/sjvn-releases-269-98cr-land-compensation-for-hydel-project/articleshow/120214464.cms). After releasing the compensation, SJVNL chairman and managing director Raj Kumar Chaudhary noted that SJVNL is committed to “responsible and inclusive development,” that the compensation was a major step towards “[honouring the rights of the local communities](https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/sjvn-releases-269-98-cr-land-compensation-for-etalin-project-in-arunachal-125041100518_1.html).” Such statements raise important questions regarding the complex relationship between dam-related development and indigenous people’s rights to land, water, and forests in India’s Northeast. Fast forward to June 2025, the Etalin HEP received [Stage-1 clearance](https://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2025/08/13/clearance-for-etalin-hydroelectric-project/) from the MoEFCC. Around the same time, protests mounted against the Siang Upper Multipurpose Project (SUMP) to be constructed on the Siang River, which is revered as “*Ane* (mother) Siang” by the Adi tribe, in the Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Although the idea of SUMP was conceived in the early 2000s, it had remained on paper until China announced the construction of a mega dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. India re-prioritized SUMP, along with Etalin HEP, fearing “[weaponised water releases](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/india-plans-mega-dam-to-counter-china-water-fears/articleshow/124229354.cms?from=mdr)” by China in the future. Although civil society groups and students’ bodies kept voicing their concerns, the government proceeded with its decision to conduct feasibility tests in mid 2025. Consequently, protests erupted in Siang and Upper Siang districts, with “[No Dam, Go Away](https://thewire.in/environment/we-will-die-for-our-lands-villagers-in-arunachals-siang-district-protest-against-mega-dam-plan/?mc_cid=3d4c3e94da&mc_eid=34933af3b4)” refrain echoing in the air. In response to the protests, the government deployed military personnel near the site of the proposed dam to ensure that the pre-feasibility assessments could be carried out without any [obstruction](https://scroll.in/latest/1082666/arunachal-pradesh-tensions-in-siang-valley-as-armed-forces-deployed-to-conduct-dam-survey). The protesting people raised [several concerns](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigenous-people-protest-dam-over-siang-river-call-for-talks-101754197894305.html) regarding the SUMP, such as displacement from ancestral lands, perpetual loss of traditional livelihoods, inundation of downstream villages, and ecological risks as the proposed site falls in a seismically active zone. It is clear that ecological, cultural, and social concerns raised by environmentalists, civil society organizations, and local people are grounded in cumulative assessments. The [Cumulative Impact Assessment](https://moef.gov.in/uploads/2018/04/CIA_CCS_Dibangbasin-1.pdf) (CIA) of the Dibang river basin highlighted the ramifications of HEPs in the Dibang valley. The official position on low-carbon energy and national security concerns considering Arunachal Pradesh’s strategic location bordering China perhaps provides the justification for the implementation of mega HEPs in the Dibang valley. However, these projects also threaten to aggravate the social and environmental costs. Mega dam projects reflect a model of development, which marginalize indigenous and subaltern groups and exacerbate disparities in countries of the Global South, as post-development critiques by those like [Arturo Escobar](https://voidnetwork.gr/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Encountering_Development-The-Making-and-the-Unmaking-of-the-Third-World-by-Arturo-Escobar.pdf) would argue. The push for fast-track clearances for the Etalin HEP and SUMP can be understood in this context. As per recent reports, although there have been vehement protests against the SUMP, some communities in the Siang Valley have begun to [sign MoUs](https://arunachalobserver.org/2025/08/20/sump-begging-3rd-village-to-sign-mou-to-support-survey-for-pfr-dcm-welcomes/) with the government of Arunachal Pradesh supporting pre-feasibility studies for SUMP. According to officials, the local people have become optimistic about the benefits that the HEP could bring to the region, such as [employment and economic growth](https://www.indiatodayne.in/arunachal-pradesh/story/parong-village-backs-siang-upper-multipurpose-project-signs-mou-for-pre-feasibility-report-1280460-2025-09-20). However, the Siang Indigenous Farmers Forum (SIFF), which spearheaded the protests in May 2025, alleges that the MoUs were signed [without community consent](https://northeastlivetv.com/around-ne/arunachalpradesh/arunachal-siff-alleges-reav-govt-mou-on-siang-mega-project-signed-without-community-consent/). The SIFF [believes](https://northeastlivetv.com/around-ne/arunachalpradesh/siff-to-submit-memorandum-to-pm-modi-on-upper-siang-dam-project-during-his-visit-to-arunachal-on-sept-22/) that the Indian Prime Minister should visit Arunachal Pradesh and talk to the people before taking any decision regarding the SUMP. The above complexities, therefore, raise serious questions about what is at the centre of development in Arunachal Pradesh—national security, economic development, or indigenous people’s rights? In a nutshell, the ongoing HEPs reinforce questions about building mega infrastructure at the cost of the environment, indigenous peoples’ rights, binding norms on social protection, substantive justice, and communities-inclusive policies to govern the environment. --- **About the Author**: Dr. Amrita Saikia is an Assistant Professor at the School of Liberal Arts & Humanities, Woxsen University, Hyderabad, and an Associate at the German Institute for Global and Area (GIGA) Studies, Hamburg, Germany.

The conference will be organized by **Description** Are the dead alive? Is death a finitude or a metamorphosis? If death is a finitude, why are the dead often carefully processed, interred, cremated, desiccated, and memorialized? Are these merely rituals of remembrance, or are they practices that also mark a change of state not only for the living but also for the dead, where the dead metamorphose – like pupa to butterfly – take wing and fly away to another world? Is that why death is problematic because the natural course has been cut short, and the dead are not able to metamorphose and fly away? Is the grief that follows such departures merely caused by the inability to say goodbye, either due to suddenness or the absence of the living at the moment of passing, or is it because they interrupt the procedures that make possible the transmutation of the dead, who, being unable to depart, enter into intimate relationships with the living? Is such grief an intra-psychic phenomenon that requires counseling, or is it the dead conversing with the living and imploring them, through entreaty and threat, to find ways of transmuting them and thus helping them to depart? In short, this is a call to reflect, cross-culturally and historically, on whether there are good and bad deaths; how we process the dead as a material entity and why; how this processing of the dead changes with new technologies such as the crematorium; how and why we mourn and memorialize the dead, including categories of the dead like perinates that were mourned but not memorialized earlier; what are the hieroglyphics of the relationships that the dead forge with the living; and how do we reckon with the continuing absent presence of the dead? In other words, do we grieve for the dead, or do the dead, too, grieve for the living? If such grief is unnaturally long, are the living to be shrunk by the psychiatrist under the sign of “prolonged grief disorder” (APA 2022), or is it to be played out and addressed by an appropriate death rite for the dead? **Share this:** [Previous Article](/events/department-of-art-media-and-performance-organizes-a-screening-conversation-session-with-amar-kanwar-monica-juneja/) [Next Article](/events/department-of-international-relations-and-global-studies-irgs-in-collaboration-with-the-office-of-dean-of-research-and/)

![](images/main_image6.1600x0.webp) # Computational and Theoretical Soft Matter The research focus of the Computational and Theoretical Soft Matter Lab lies at the interface of computational modeling of soft matter systems, solvation thermodynamics, interfacial phenomena and statistical mechanics. Currently, we are focussed on understanding the role of osmolytes and cosolvents on the phase behavior of responsive macromolecular systems, both synthetic and biopolymer, which are employed in a wide variety of applications such as sensors, drug delivery and smart surfaces. Our interest lies in the identification of molecular mechanisms governing the phase transitions in these systems through a combination of molecular simulations, free energy calculations and solvation theories. Another aspect of our work is to develop methods for the thermodynamic characterization of the solvation behavior of macromolecular solutes using molecular simulations together with advanced sampling methods and theoretical frameworks such as Kirkwood-Buff analysis and Small System thermodynamics. Due to the unconventional nature of these systems, an important part of this work is the development of algorithms and codes for the computation of interfacial thermodynamic properties Location of Lab: F103D Faculty Members: Dr. Swaminath Bharadwaj Gourishankar https://swaminath6989.github.io/index.html

# Physicochemical Characterization, Formation Mechanism and Human Health Risk Assessment of Size-Fractionated Particulate Matter Emitted from Stationary Diesel Engine Exhausts Through an Experimental Set-Up of Environmental Chamber | Department of Civil | School of Engineering

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-engineering/research/physicochemical-characterization-formation-mechanism-and-human-health-risk-assessment-of-size-fractionated-particulate-matter/

## Content
Research Project ### Physicochemical Characterization, Formation Mechanism And Human Health Risk Assessment Of Size-Fractionated Particulate Matter This research project has been planned for a thorough investigation into physicochemical characterization and formation mechanisms of size-fractionated PM at ten different sizes, ranging from 56 nm to 18 µm emitted from exhausts of a stationary diesel engine through a controlled experimental set-up of environmental chamber at laboratory scale, where a conducive situation is prevailed for atmospheric reactions to take place. The short-term acute and long-term chronic exposures to several toxic chemicals including trace elements, ions, carbons, inorganics and organics present in airborne particulate matter (PM) or aerosols emitted from exhausts of non-road stationary diesel engines cause adverse human health effects, such as cancer and many other respiratory diseases. The ultrafine particles (aerodynamic diameter (AED) ≤ 100 nm) and fine particles (AED ≤ 2.5 µm) generated from these stationary diesel engines have significant contributions to total diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions in both developed and developing countries. To find technological solutions for mitigation of pollution from such significant air polluting sources, it is necessary to examine the cause-effect relationship between constituents of these particles and atmospheric mechanisms those facilitate formation of secondary particles. Although, several studies in the past have examined the microstructural behavior of the particles emitted from stationary engine exhausts, there still remain many research gaps to address formation mechanisms of secondary particles under real atmospheric conditions. The chemical constituents of PM consist of eight inorganic ions, twenty four trace elements and eight fractions of organic and elemental carbons. The formation of secondary organic and inorganic PM will be examined under different engine load conditions. The interrelationship between predicted PM acidity, meteorological conditions and secondary PM formation at different size ranges will be studied. The human health risk assessment will be conducted for cancer and non-cancer effects because of exposure to toxic elements in ultrafine and fine particles. The depositions of particles at different regions of human respiratory system (head, tracheobronchial and pulmonary) will also be predicted. **Funding agency:** DST, Govt. of India **Faculty:** Dr. Sailesh Behera, Associate Professor

# World in Flux: Geopolitics in the Age of Disruption

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/news/world-in-flux-geopolitics-in-the-age-of-disruption-1/

## Content
![](images/world_in_flux_geopolitics_in_the_age_of_disruption.1600x0.webp) ## World in Flux: Geopolitics in the Age of Disruption The timeless aphorism of Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci - The old world order is dying, and the new world struggles to be born. Now is the time of monsters - rings profoundly true even for the present geopolitical moment. To analytically unpeel this critical inflexion point, the Department of International Relations and Governance Studies, Shiv Nadar University, had the privilege of hosting distinguished retired diplomat and acclaimed novelist Ambassador Vikas Swarup. Ambassador Swarup maintained that the tectonic shifts in the global order can be aptly captured through a chessboard analogy. While the yesteryears of this order were characterised by slow and calculated manoeuvres by the key players, the present moment is witnessing brisk and unpredictable moves - a sort of geopolitics on steroids. The re-election of Donald Trump as the US President has been even more disruptive than before, as he simultaneously courts Russia, competes with China and belittles NATO. However, as Ambassador Swarup submitted, Donald Trump is simply the loudest symptom of a broader pathology afflicting the current world order. Thus, to preclude any potential of missing the wood for the trees, Ambassador Swarup donned his analytical hat and neatly presented what he felt were the ten big takeaways from the present moment. The first was the unravelling of the international rules-based order. Broadly functional as a liberal international order, helmed by the United States, enshrining cherished principles like territorial sovereignty, liberal democracy and capitalism, and imbued with a considerable degree of legitimacy, this order had so far presented at least an illusion of fairness to the realm of the international. This chimaera had now been de-mystified with the global reticence on war crimes, brazen contravention of the rules by the very rule-creators and the element of false exceptionalism and impunity in the conduct of great powers. This was closely entangled with a crisis of multilateralism - the cooperative ability to work together for peace and prosperity. As a corollary, the world had increasingly been fragmented into smaller groupings, antagonistic to each other. Ambassador Swarup believed that the development resulted from three factors: the eroding legitimacy of governance structures, the reluctance of great powers to give shared and differential treatment to the emerging powers and economies, and the extra-institutional geopolitical moves by the supposedly responsible great powers. While bilateralism and protectionism were the natural outcomes of such a crisis, it also engendered a spate of mini-lateral issue-specific coalitions - G20, G7, AUKUS, BRICS, and Five Eyes. Ambassador Swarup suggested that any return to multilateralism must go through realistic institutional architecture reforms. The third facet of the present moment was the retreat of globalisation and a concomitant surge in economic nationalism. The enduring postulate that a rising economic tide of the free market would lift all nations had lost its traditional purchase, with rampant inequality and unemployment worldwide. As a panacea, most governments had resorted to a culture of self-sufficiency and economic isolationism by foisting astronomical tariffs on imports. This remained antithetical to the liberal internationalist axiom of cooperation and interdependence amongst nations through the logic of comparative advantage. The other potent fallout of the present moment was the ascent of right-wing politics all across the world and the erosion of liberal democracy. As a form of popular politics claiming to embody the general will of the people, right-wing populism and its reactionary effects had systematically undermined democracy in the different societies of Asia, Europe and America. Ambassador Swarup had three-fold reasoning to explain its causality - the failed liberal promise of economic prosperity leading to significant financial distress, the status anxiety of the native citizens of those countries to the influx of migrants, and finally, the disruptive effects of technology. It was only through greater income equality, reconciliation of the multiple cultural identities and robust accountability measures within Big Tech that this populist zeitgeist could be countered. The US-China contest for hegemony was to constitute the fifth dimension of this world order. As the world's second-largest economy, with alternative geoeconomic prototypes like the Belt and Road Initiative and boasting critical technology, Beijing was now well placed to convert a trade war with America into a full-blown geopolitical struggle. Washington was also not ready to relent, having already undertaken different legislations to foster greater techno-strategic self-sufficiency and counter Chinese penetration. As Ambassador Swarup cautioned, with the retreat of a strategically altruistic America and the rise of a crudely transactional one, the Sino-American rivalry could escalate significantly, with Taiwan becoming a potential flashpoint. The climate crisis and the struggle for sustainable development were the other critical fallout of this world order. With rising mercury levels and carbon emissions, the ecosystem was gradually advancing to collapse, with vast swathes of terrestrial and marine life turning inhospitable. The situation remained further exacerbated as the world's leading power completely turned back on all its ecological commitments and arbitrarily withdrew from the climate accords. The disruptive implications of technology constituted the seventh dimension of this geopolitical moment, with artificial intelligence, quantum computing and robotics not merely advancing but also reshaping our global economy. Having deftly cracked open the operating system of humans, artificial intelligence could now be weaponised to fuel hatred and misinformation and distort and manipulate human attention. The path ahead involved balancing innovation and ethicality to flesh out the truthful signal from the digital noise. The scramble for resources and the energy wars marked another geostrategic takeaway from the present moment. With the rising geoeconomic stocks of critical minerals and rare earths like lithium and cobalt, the new age wars would now be fought over controlling such energy resources. Ambassador Swarup alluded to the potential geostrategic nodes as the South China Sea and Greenland, evoking the attention of the great powers in the time to come. The novel nature of security threats in the form of cyber warfare and asymmetric conflicts was the penultimate facet of this world order. The October attacks carried out by terror outfits like Hamas, which had adroitly destabilised the surveillance system and breached the celebrated Israeli intelligence networks, testified to the degree of sophistication presently harboured by terror outfits. This was compounded by cyber criminals hacking communication networks and stealing intellectual property rights. The other theatre of insecurity emanated from the strategic abandonment of the nuclear non-proliferation exercises by the key nuclear powers. The final facet of this world order, and in all probability the only affirmative development, was the spirited rise of the Global South. The resilient nation-states of Asia, Africa and Latin America were no longer peripheral to the order-making processes but were on course to become the upcoming powerhouses of the world. With their institutional architecture through BRICS and ASEAN and their rising demographic and economic heft in formations like G20, the Global South possessed the capacity to forge a post-Western world order with a transformative potential. In closing, Ambassador Swarup averred that India has a crucial role in this evolving stage. As a pivotal actor of the Global South, with youthful demography, technological prowess and astronomical vision, New Delhi faces a geopolitical sweet spot, given its multi-aligned posture in global politics. Finally, while her capacity to shoulder transnational responsibilities has already been vindicated through her vaccine diplomacy during the coronavirus pandemic, New Delhi needed to astutely cultivate a friendly neighbourhood dynamic and a densely integrated economic framework for the region to consolidate its role as a leading power. The talk was followed by some insightful interventions made by the audience present. Such reflections pertained to the de-dollarisation of the global economy, the future of populist right-wing movements, and New Delhi's positions in the multi-polar matrix. Ambassador Swarup flagged some crucial issues in the discussion that followed. While he posited that such populist waves operate in boom and bust cycles, the immediate in its favour would not die down quickly. He underscored how the bipartisan consensus in New Delhi over multi-alignment will see India smoothly weather the storm. Finally, he remained cautiously optimistic about the rise of a new global statesman and visionary leader who could tackle the multiple faultlines of the present juncture and lead the world to a better place.

# Shiv Nadar University shortlisted for THE Asia Awards 2025

## Shiv Nadar University shortlisted for THE Asia Awards 2025 ***The University has been shortlisted in the ‘Outstanding Contribution to Regional Development’ category for the SHIKSHA Plus – Adult Literacy Program*** Shiv Nadar University has been shortlisted for the THE Asia Awards 2025 in the category of “Outstanding Contribution to Regional Development”. The SHIKSHA Initiative began in 2012 with an intervention in government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh, utilizing SCERT-approved digital content. Despite these efforts, gaps in literacy levels persisted, particularly among parents at the village and gram panchayat levels. Many parents struggled to understand or engage with their children's education, highlighting the need for an adult literacy program by 2015-16. To address this, the team researched existing programs and government initiatives. They discovered that the National Literacy Mission Authority (NLMA) had developed State Resource Centres (SRCs) in each State. In Uttar Pradesh, the SRC had created primers called "Nai Kiran Textbooks," which took around 8 months to transform a non-literate person into a literate one. However, the SHIKSHA team found this duration too long for adults, who typically have shorter attention spans. Leveraging technology, the Shiv Nadar Foundation's SHIKSHA team developed a digital content based on instructional design and the program is mapped to the Nai Kiran framework. This new program, SHIKSHA Plus, reduced the learning period to just 90 days, extending up to 120 days in practice. The SHIKSHA Plus Adult Literacy Program engages learners through audio-visual aids (Laptop & Projector) and scientifically designed digital content based on the Nai Kiran textbooks, with volunteers facilitating the lessons in regional languages. Extensive research focused on adult learners using the andragogy method ensured that the program met their specific learning needs. Major activities of the SHIKSHA Plus Program include selecting blocks and gram panchayats, training volunteers, and raising community awareness about literacy. Volunteers conduct household surveys using the Drishti App to identify non-literate learners, organize demo classes, and select 15 learners per batch. Each learner receives a learning kit and follows a structured 90-day teaching plan, with assessments every 15 days. The SHIKSHA Plus Program's design ensures it meets adult learners' needs while providing an engaging learning experience. Community libraries have been established to support continued learning, and the program has been extended to 16 jails across 15 districts, making 1,700 inmates’ literate. **Major Activities of SHIKSHA Plus Program** The selection of blocks and Gram Panchayats begins with thorough secondary data at the block level, after which a few Gram Panchayats are shortlisted. In those Gram Panchayats, volunteers are selected and hired. These selected volunteers undergo 8 days of regular upskill training is conducted in two phases: a 2-day pre-selection training and a 6-day regular training. The training focuses on their roles and responsibilities in the SHIKSHA Plus Program, including course delivery, conducting classes at learning centers, and executing assessments. The initial task is community mobilisation in the shortlisted villages within the Gram Panchayats, with the objective of raising awareness about the SHIKSHA Plus Program. After mobilization, household surveys are conducted to identify prospective non-literate learners. Once the prospective learners are identified, their data is entered into the Drishti App. A demo class is organised for four days, where all learners undergo a tool-based evaluation to determine their literacy level. From this group, 15 learners are selected out of 20-25 participants. After the selection of 15 learners, a batch is formed in a specifically design data entry and monitoring app known as Drishti App. On the first day of the batch, a baseline assessment is conducted, and each learner receives a kit that includes a jute bag, slate and chalk, Nai Kiran book, workbook, notebook, pencil, eraser, and sharpener. A 90-day teaching plan is provided to the volunteer, which includes baseline, midline, and Endline assessments, with six assessment days and a total of 9 days dedicated to assessments during the 90-day course. Assessments are conducted every 15 days during the course delivery process. After the 90-day course is completed according to the teaching plan, an Endline assessment is conducted, and the entire course journey is tracked through mentoring and monitoring by the SHIKSHA team. Learners who successfully complete all six assessments receive a certificate. **Know more about Shiksha Initiative:** [**www.ShikshaInitiative.org**](http://www.shikshainitiative.org) [**http://www.youtube.com/@shikshainitiative6086**](http://www.youtube.com/@shikshainitiative6086) [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODKwC9iUak&t=3s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NODKwC9iUak&t=3s) [Previous Article](/events/natures-extreme-and-smallest-liquid-quark-gluon-plasma/) [Next Article](/events/good-phenomenology-in-hard-time-a-pragmatic-approach/)

## Faculty at School of Humanities and Social Sciences ![Atul Mishra](images/atul_mishra.1600x0.webp) # Atul Mishra Associate Professor and Head of Department School of Humanities and Social Sciences ##### Contact Information * Email: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c6a7b2b3aae8abafb5aeb4a786b5a8b3e8a3a2b3e8afa8) * Number: [461](tel:461) [View Curriculum Vitae](/site/assets/files/5742/cv_atul_mishra_july_2025_1.pdf) ## Research Interest My areas of competence in terms of academic research, teaching, and public affairs commentary are international theory, modern Indian international thought, Indian foreign policy, and contemporary international affairs. My scholarship is often in conversation with realism, liberalism and postcolonialism in both their political and international theory variants. I have closely followed the emergence of modern international relations theory, and I keep abreast of contemporary developments in the field. I am also interested in international theory traditions in the non-West, and while sceptical of claims around national schools of theory, I am interested in the sociology of how national constructs shape theory and theorizing. I have published works around notions of territoriality and sovereignty that have emerged from this interest. A related interest is in international political theory concerned with questions of order, justice, secularism, equity and democracy. As regards international thought, my first love is Indian international thought across the modern and contemporary periods. A part of this interest has translated into works on Indian visions of regional and international orders, and I am currently writing a book that examines ideas of a South Asian polity articulated during the first-half of the 20th century. I’m also fascinated by the notions of warfare and conquest found in pre-modern Indian thought. My interest in Indian foreign policy pertains to the contemporary period, wherein the linkages between domestic politics and foreign policy and India’s response to shifting terrains of geopolitics are primary interests. Finally, I take interest in both historical and contemporary international affairs. The historical part is mostly concerned with the geopolitical dynamics found on the subcontinent, particularly during the political transition of the 18th century and the emergence of the regional subsystem. In contemporary international affairs, I keenly follow the geopolitics and ideological contestation involving the West and the non-West. I am the author (with Rajesh Rajagopalan) of *Nuclear South Asia: Keywords and Concepts* (Oxon and New Delhi: Routledge, 2014) and of *The Sovereign Lives of India and Pakistan* (New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2021). My papers have been published in *International Affairs*, *India Review*, *The Economic and Political Weekly*, *Studies in Indian Politics*, *International Studies*, *South Asian Survey*, and *Strategic Analysis*. I regularly lecture at the Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service of the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. I have written commentaries for *The Hindu*, *The Indian Express*, and *Dawn* among others, and I am currently a columnist for *The Hindustan Times*. I am open to supervising doctoral projects that align with my areas of research and interest, particularly international thought and theory. ## Education * **2013,**Ph.D., Jawaharlal Nehru University * **2008,**M.Phil., Jawaharlal Nehru University * **2006,**M.A., Jawaharlal Nehru University * **2004,**B.A., Mumbai University ## Work Experience * **07/18-Present** Associate Professor, International Relations and Governance Studies in School of Humanities and Social Sciences, Shiv Nadar University, Delhi-NCR * **07/17-07/18** Assistant Professor, Shiv Nadar University * **08/10-06/17** Assistant Professor, Central University of Gujarat ## My areas of competence in terms of academic research, teaching, and public affairs commentary are international theory, modern Indian international thought, Indian foreign policy, and contemporary international affairs.

# The Mathematics of Disease Outbreaks: SNU Researcher Wins Prestigious J. B. Shukla Award | School of Natural Sciences

**Source:** https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-natural-sciences/news/the-mathematics-of-disease-outbreaks-snioe-researcher-wins-prestigious-j-b-shukla-award/

## Content
![](images/a_2.1600x0.webp) ## The Mathematics of Disease Outbreaks: SNU Researcher Wins Prestigious J. B. Shukla Award Every year, the Indian Mathematical Society confers the prestigious J. B. Shukla Award to Indian scientists who have significantly contributed to the field of mathematical biology. Named for prominent Indian mathematician Jung Bahadur Shukla, the award recognises the most noteworthy research paper across the fields of bioinformatics, mathematical epidemiology, mathematical ecology, and all others that fall under the broad umbrella of mathematical biology. This year, the award was jointly won by Dr. Samit Bhattacharyya of the Shiv Nadar University and Viney Kumar, one of his Ph.D. students. Their paper, which was published in [*Chaos, Solitons, & Fractals*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2023.114014) in October 2023, explains how people’s feelings and social interactions influence their decision to get vaccinated during a disease outbreak. Dr. Bhattacharyya has been active in the field of infectious disease modelling for nearly 15 years. This is a multidisciplinary field of research that sits at the intersection of science, mathematics, and public health, employing techniques like compartmental epidemiological models to explain disease transmission and game theory, as well as adaptive modelling to incorporate human behaviours. These models allow researchers to understand key factors such as how quickly a disease may spread, which groups are most at risk, and how behaviours like social distancing, vaccination, or masking influence outcomes. The study of human behaviour in infectious disease modelling adds a critical layer of complexity to understanding and managing disease outbreaks. While the biology of pathogens is important, it is human behaviour—how people interact, perceive risks, and respond to interventions—that often determines the success or failure of public health strategies. Dr. Bhattacharyya’s research in this field has helped unravel a number of critical issues in public health, such as the global antibiotic resistance crisis and how it is impacted by self-medication behaviours and mosquito net usage in Sub-Saharan Africa and its influence on malaria outbreaks. One of the focal points of Dr. Bhattacharyya’s research in recent years has been the role of social media during disease outbreaks. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram can rapidly disseminate news, opinions, and personal stories, significantly influencing public perception and behaviour during an outbreak. His work explores questions like how quickly information spreads online compared to the disease itself, whether the messages shared are beneficial or harmful, and how people modify their behaviour based on what they encounter on these platforms—such as whether to get vaccinated or adhere to health guidelines. In the article, Dr. Bhattacharyya and Viney Kumar untangle the factors influencing an individual’s choice to get vaccinated, which is one of the primary means of curtailing a disease outbreak. Using a multi-faceted network model that integrates several different areas of interaction (e.g., home, online, and work), they describe how social influence has a powerful effect on vaccination decisions. Positive opinions from friends, family, and social media engender a positive opinion on vaccination, and vice versa. “*Our paper also highlights that* *small changes—like a single influential post on social media or news about a vaccine side effect—can create big shifts in how a community feels about vaccines*,” adds Dr. Bhattacharyya. Another key finding of their paper is that a person’s fear or confidence in a vaccine can spread to those around them like a ripple effect. Understanding these patterns can help public health organisations better combat misinformation and deliver more effective health campaigns. “*Timely and transparent communication, collaborations with trusted influencers, and positive social media campaigns combined with targeted interventions that address specific community concerns can help shift public attitudes*,” underscores Dr. Bhattacharyya. Currently, Dr. Bhattacharyya’s research is based out of the Disease Modelling Lab at SNU, which is unique in the Indian research ecosystem because of its focus on human behaviours in the study of epidemiology. The team at the lab is also exploring the impact of social stigma on the spread of diseases, using tuberculosis as a starting point. By bridging mathematics, epidemiology, and public health, Dr. Bhattacharyya’s research continues to offer valuable insights into how human behaviour is factored into infectious disease research, helping shape more effective responses to global health challenges.

![Ananya Mukherjee](images/new_project_48.1600x0.webp) ### Ananya Mukherjee Vice-Chancellor, Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, Delhi NCR ###### Dr. Ananya Mukherjee Dr. Ananya Mukherjee is Vice-Chancellor of Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, recently recognized as an Institution of Eminence. Attracted by the opportunity to lead such an institution, Dr. Mukherjee returned to India after spending more than two decades in two of the largest universities in Canada — the University of British Columbia and York University. Dr. Mukherjee obtained her Ph.D. from the University of Southern California, USA, and her BA and MA degrees in Economics from Jadavpur University, India. Before joining Shiv Nadar University, Dr. Mukherjee was Provost and Vice-President Academic, University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan — a fast-growing campus of a university which ranks amongst the top 40 in the world. She also led UBC’s strategy for antiracism and inclusive higher education, and has been involved in several national initiatives for higher education in Canada. Between 2015 and 2018, Dr. Mukherjee was Dean of the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies at York University, Toronto. In this capacity, she led the largest liberal arts faculty in Canada with 23,000 students from 123 countries. Dr. Mukherjee is an interdisciplinary scholar of Development. Her initial body of work focused on corporate governance and its relation to development in India/South Asia, resulting in two books, several articles in academic journals and the media. Since 2006, Dr. Mukherjee’s work has focused more on the theorization of development, beginning from a critical understanding of Amartya Sen’s work on human development. This has yielded yet another body of work including two books and many other contributions, both for academia and beyond. At York University, Dr. Mukherjee established the International Secretariat for Human Development (ISHD), an initiative dedicated to research for social change. Under her leadership as the Founding Director, ISHD collaborated with institutions such as the International Labor Organization; the UN Office for Project Services, Rome; the UN Development Program; the UN Research Institute for Social Development, and others. Dr. Mukherjee was named as one the 15 Most Influential Women in Education by Business World in 2022; amongst Canada’s 100 Most Powerful Women in 2021; and one of the five Brilliant Women in Academia by Canadian Immigrant magazine in their tribute to ‘Immigrant Women of Inspiration’ in 2016. **Message from the Vice-Chancellor** Welcome to the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence. Within just ten years, the Institution has defined a new trajectory for higher education in India. The recognition as the youngest Institution of Eminence by the Government of India is a testament to this trajectory. As we look forward to the next decade, we will continue to drive foundational thinking within, across, and beyond disciplines – be it the sciences, management, entrepreneurship, engineering, the humanities and social sciences, or art. Our focus will remain steadfast on the fundamental pillars of a great university: a holistic, multidisciplinary education, research and innovation, and a commitment to the betterment of society. We wish to be defined not only by the outcomes we achieve: our aspirations are more audacious. Our agenda is to transform the very ways in which we learn, discover, teach, analyze, act, live, and come together to create an institution of higher learning. Recognition and respect for the diversity of people and ideas, a rational spirit of inclusiveness, a global perspective, and a sense of community are core values we uphold.

## Content
## GPA Calculator Estimate your academic growth with ease. ## Credit System Each Course offered will carry credits which are calculated on the basis of the number of contact hours per week for a course that runs the whole semester. The listing of the credits will be given as L:T:P, where L is the number of Lecture Classes, T is the number of Tutorial Classes; and P is the number of Lab Sessions. A typical Lab Session is usually between 2 and 3 hours' duration. For example, a course with 3:1:1 credits is a 5 credit course where the student shall attend 3 lectures, 1 tutorial and 1 lab session every week for the whole semester.

# About rslookup

## Content
# About rslookup rslookup is a platform to find resources that students of SNIoE might need in their day to day life. ## What is rslookup? [rslookup](https://rslookup.abs.moe) is a platform to find resources such as documents, professor details, lab locations, amenities and much more that students of SNIoE might need in their day to day life. The goal of the site is to be your first stop when you need to know about anything in the college. ## How did rslookup get started? This project started as a personal passion project on Sep 27, 2023 after I missed an office hour with a professor because I couldn't find the location of the office. He did not have it in his email signature or in the course handout, nor is mentioned in the SNU website. So I went through each academic building to find his office but couldn't find it. I've always liked the idea of open and free software, given that almost everything needed to build a website is available for free and I've always wanted to leave a mark in the university that I spent 4 years in. Although its a very important information, it is not available in the college website. So I thought of creating a platform where students can find all the information they need in one place. ## Where's the data coming from? Initially, the vision for the project was to make the website crowd sourced, where students can add resources that they find useful. But due to the lack of time and resources, I had to think of another way to keep the data up to date. ![hero neko gif](images/neko.CilRimNx.webp) ![Student Council](images/student_council.1qGbPRmb.jpg) Where else to get the most accurate and up to date information than the Student Council? The Student Council is the governing body of the students in the college and they have access to all the information that students might need. After signing a [Memorandum of Understanding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQAr8-4FiogjW7E-wyhhlZvXNPnI4LpLCgL78VxbYxk/edit?usp=sharing) with the 2024-25 Student Council, I was able to strike a deal with them to use the website as a platform to host all the resources that they initially was sharing with the students through linktree. Check out the [Credits](/resources) page to see the people who are maintaining the data. ## Tools used * [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Web framework * [Google Sheets](-) - "Database" (Closed source) * [GitHub](https://github.com/ABSanthosh/rslookup) - Source code * [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - Web hosting * [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/y8tgFPWUy9p8ZVuT1eR5JN/rslookup?type=design&node-id=278%3A120&mode=design&t=ElCuS1IFfRk5SYYK-1) - Design * [GoatCounter](https://rslookup.goatcounter.com/) - Analytics ## Contribute If you have any suggestions for features that you think will be useful to others, feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/ABSanthosh/rslookup/issues/new) in the github or fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/ELq8hJq6m8ZcTrLA8).

In Why the Government’s National Institutional Ranking Framework Shiv Nadar (NIRF), the University has been the youngest institution in the 'top 100' Overall list for the last five years. University? Why Study International Relations at at Shiv Nadar University? The Department of International Relations and Governance Studies has dedicated faculty members who are deeply invested in teaching and research and who are keen to offer well-rounded training and exposure to students interested in studying international relations. We have a unique niche in terms of our ability to combine global history with cutting-edge theoretical knowledge applied to various practical global challenges. The Department is attentive to the context of Asia in the 21st century, which entails not replicating any single dominant worldview but being open to a plurality of perspectives. The Department does not simply train students to receive existing knowledge but actively encourages them to take their first steps towards research- ing and developing an initial appreciation of how one contributes to knowledge creation. We are confident of the training we give to our students. Some of our students who have completed their undergraduate education with us have secured admission to prestigious universities abroad for further studies. Finally, our canvas for studying international relations is genuinely expansive: from focusing on international organisations to the possibility of learning a foreign language (Mandarin) and then specializing in China, we offer an exciting spread of possibilities. Curriculum skills are imparted through the assignments and that familiarise students with other disciplines become B.A. (Research) in International evaluation exercises within our courses and available from the 3rd semester onwards.

They also consult with major Friedrich-Alexander-Universität governmental and non-governmental Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany and organizations and author reports on Sciences Po, Paris. Academic Collaborations Faculty at the department draws on a whole range of academic networks. In terms of our teaching, we have invited guest faculty from leading universities worldwide. As illustrative of this, in a course on international law and world politics, scholars from Cornell University (USA), King's College, London (UK), Cambridge University (UK), San Diego State University (USA), and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (Chile) spoke online to International Relations Major students. Regarding our research, colleagues have also presented their work at the National University of Singapore, the Berlin Social Science Center, the University of Melbourne, and other academic settings. At the national level, we have signed MoUs with the National Maritime Foundation and the Institute of Chinese Studies in the recent past. Students actively draw on these intellectual networks when we eventually write letters of recommendation to them to leading universities around the world. Our B.A. program students can also study a semester at an overseas university and then transfer the earned credits to their degree at Shiv Nadar University. This is facilitated through collaborations between Shiv Nadar University's International Office and universities abroad. In Monsoon 2023, two students of the department selected under New Southbound Policy Short-term Program studied at National Quemoy University, Taiwan, taking courses in international relations and Mandarin extensively. However, it is essential to note that mere admission to the B.A. program in International Relations does not guarantee an opportunity to study a semester abroad. Prospective students and caregivers must take note of factors such as availability of opportunity, a competitive process, and the cost of studying abroad in this regard.

Masters Program in English 2024-2025 Department of English School of Humanities and Social Sciences Shiv Nadar University Department of English The English Department at SNU offers a two-year M. A. program. As part of a research–based university, students are encouraged to engage with the department’s areas of research, culminating in a 6000-8000 word individually supervised thesis in the last semester. SNU’s English faculty has wide-ranging, interdisciplinary research training reinforced by diverse learning and teaching experience in Indian and international universities. Their current research interests are in the areas of novel, Victorian literature, newspaper/magazine/periodical cultures, realism, translation studies, creative writing, digital humanities, South Asian Literature, gender and sexuality, and World Literature. This prospectus includes information about the M.A. English program for the 2024-25 academic year. The Department accepts only full-time students. M.A. students are admitted once a year in the Monsoon semester. M.A. in English The M.A. in English at SNU is designed to combine rigour with creativity. It will take students through the significant moments in English literary history and world literature but it also incorporates courses in critical and cultural theory, translation, creative writing and visual theory. Our pedagogy includes class room lectures designed to gradually draw a student into the complexity of texts, and also more interactive, seminar-based formats possible only with small groups. Above all, our excellent student-teacher ratio has enabled us to put in place a rigorous, multi-tiered, and varied program of writing that includes compulsory courses in academic writing, writing for the general public, writing narratives as well as an individually supervised M.A. thesis based on prescribed weekly readings. Most of these writing activities will be based on intensive one-to- one interactions between teacher and student. It is our intention to equip our M.A. students with the skills needed for a range of competitive examinations as well as for careers in publishing and the media. We also see potential academics in our students and we are committed to supporting them through research careers in every possible way. Shiv Nadar University offers teaching assistantships and fee waivers which will bring down the cost of their education considerably. Semester-wise break-up of the M.A program The M.A. degree is awarded on the completion of 15 courses and 1 compulsory supervised thesis of 6000- 8000 words. Each of these carry 4 credits and candidates will need 16 x 4 = 64 credits in order to successfully complete the M.A. Courses will be spread across 4 semesters, as per the following schedule: Semester I: 4 compulsory courses Semester II: 4 compulsory courses Semester III: 4 compulsory courses Semester IV: 3 compulsory courses and supervised thesis Here is an overview of the courses offered: Compulsory Courses Advanced Academic Writing Literary Theory Writing Narratives Translation Studies Modernism The Global Eighteenth Century Incipient Modernities: The Production of the Popular in South Nineteenth Century and the Asia Making of the Modern Analyzing Culture The Literary and the Visual Conceptualizing World Literature Post-Colonial Theory Art and Technology Photographic Objects from Curation to Cultural Analytics Nineteenth-Century Poetry Supervised Thesis Evaluation Rather than fall back on the traditional 3-hour examination as the sole mode of evaluating a student’s performance in each course, the M.A program will follow multiple modes of evaluation stretching through the semester and aimed at testing the student’s knowledge of the materials studied, the development of his or her analytical abilities and his or her ability to write with clarity and coherence. Each instructor will decide on and declare his or her evaluation methods at the beginning of the course. These may include tests, seminar presentations, participation at seminars and above all assessment of written work that students will be required to submit from time to time.

Modernism 4 credits This course aims to introduce the students to modernist literatures and cultures from Europe in a detailed and comprehensive manner. To this end, students will read, engage with, and respond to James Joyce’s Ulysses (1920). Alongside, they will work their way through writings that are now recognised as key to understanding modernism as a significant creative and cultural aesthetic, philosophy, and ideology in early 20 th century Europe. Aims of the Course/Expected Learning Outcomes As they complete the course, the students should be able to: ● Identify and analyse key aesthetic, political, and ethical features of modernist literatures and cultures in Europe. ● Discuss the continuities and disjunctions between realism and modernism. ● Comment on the evolution and consolidation of the modernist novel, especially in the works of Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, and James Joyce. ● Appreciate the singular importance of Joyce’s Ulysses as a modernist text, as the successor to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), and as the precursor to Finnegans Wake (1939). Curriculum Content Unit 1: Introduction to Modernism Points of Discussion: What is modernism? Does modernism really “make it new”? Is modernism different from “realism”? What, if any, are the characteristic markers of modernist poetry, theatre, and the novel? Unit 2: Joyce in/and Modernism Points of Discussion: Why read Joyce? How to read Joyce? What is Joyce’s “High” modernism? What kind of space does he occupy in the canon? What is the nature of Joyce’s (personal) politics, especially of national location and gender? What importance does Ulysses have among Joyce’s prose works? How does it develop some themes that the author touched in Dubliners and Portrait? What relationship does the novel have, if any, with Finnegans Wake? Unit 3: Joyce’s Ulysses We will read and discuss two chapters from the novel every week. Points of Discussion: The nature of Ulysses—its “adaptation” of Homer’s Odyssey, its explorations of various Irish contexts and the city-space of Dublin, its structure; the nature of time, history and myth in Ulysses, especially the figuration of repetition in its narrative; the “ordinariness” of language, imagery, and socio-cultural discourse in Joyce’s novel—new linguistic and expressive constructions, “cuss” and “profane” words, descriptions of sexuality and desire in particular; and key characters in Ulysses: Stephen Dedalus, Leopold Bloom, and Molly Bloom. Evaluation 1. Attendance and Participation: 10 percent 2. Mid-semester test: 30 percent 3. End-semester assignment: 60 percent VI. The Global 18th Century 4 credits It is impossible to understand 18th Century Europe without understanding the 18th century as a global phenomenon. This course will be interdisciplinary and will track various strands through literary analysis, cultural studies and history. Decades of the long eighteenth century are remarkable for the prose output of essayists, diarists, pamphleteers, writers of conduct books, and travelogues. The rise of political parties, mushrooming of clubs and coffee houses, and the new publishing houses gave huge impetus to prose writings. This course will also track that particular moment of European history when the common public started asking uncomfortable questions about ‘imperialism’. From a geopolitical perspective, this course will resonate deeply with 21st century political realities.

Incipient Modernities : The Nineteenth Century and the Making of the Modern 4 credits This course locates, in the literature of the nineteenth century, some of the most characteristic conceptual breakthroughs that have come to constitute what we , from the standpoint of the 21st century, would call the contemporary.

Art and Technology 4 credits Course summary: The course will discuss, mainly, the relation between art and technology, where 'technology' is understood not only as the various techniques of production, fabrication and fabulation that are available at specific moments of production; but also as a condition which makes some techniques possible or impossible. While taking a few examples from painting and sculpting and literary writing, the discussion will mainly focus on how we understand the relation between art and technology, often seen as opposites of each other. After a discussion of the history of various techniques that available technology makes possible or impossible, we shall move on to more contemporary issues of 20th century art and 21st century art. Course outline: Unit 1: A theoretical consideration of what technology means and does in contemporary society; discussions on modes of production, obsolescence, networks; discussions on authenticity, mechanical and digital reproductions, circulation, and crypto-art; discussion on binaries, bio-art, installations. ● Simondon, Gilbert. ‘About Technical Mentality.’ Revue philosophique de la France et de létranger 131.3 (2006): 343-357. ● Benjamin, Walter. ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.’ Illuminations: Essays and Reflections.

Evaluation: Continuous Assessment with in-class responses (10%), Mid-term (40%) and End-term (50%) assignments. XIV. Photographic Objects: From Curation to Cultural Analysis 4 credits How do we, as ‘readers’ of photographs, understand the still image? How can these understandings be communicated through formal descriptions in the process of building digital photographic collections? This course investigates photographs from diverse contexts — from early Victorian photography to photographs on the social web (e.g. Flickr and Instagram) — in order to gain a clear idea of the choices that need to be made while creating repositories that may aid their study. Beyond theoretical paradigms, the lectures focus on computational methods that may be used to describe and analyse the digitised photographic object.

This program is curated to bridge the gap left by traditional three-year undergraduate degree programs, which typically emphasise classroom teaching and basic laboratory techniques but rarely cultivate the skills necessary to tackle real-world scientific questions and contemporary research problems. Inspired by the significant impact of Shiv Nadar University's fourth-year thesis component in the BSc (Research) in Biotechnology program, this format extends similar research-intensive experiences to graduates from other institutions. The program is unburdened by the constraints of a full degree program, enabling participants to immerse themselves in the University's vibrant research ecosystem, gaining focused expertise and valuable exposure crucial for advancing their careers. WHY IS THIS PROGRAM IMPORTANT? The program offers an ideal and unique platform to tackle critical academic challenges effectively. The one-year post-bacc program equips students with rigorous laboratory skills and scientific research competencies by leveraging advanced infrastructure, distinguished faculty expertise, and a vibrant intellectual environment in the University. This supports the sustained growth and innovation essential to the global life science ecosystem. The program catalyses innovation within the global life science ecosystem by integrating rigorous research with targeted professional development. HOW IS THIS PROGRAM DIFFERENT? The thoughtfully crafted structure prioritising immersive, mentored research over conventional coursework sets this program apart. Unlike programs that only provide fragmented or technique-based lab exposure, our program offers a research-first experience anchored in scientific inquiry. The program begins with a short foundations segment, introducing students to key research methodologies across disciplines. This is followed by a sustained immersion segment where each student becomes part of an active research group led by a faculty investigator—this hands-on component forms the program's core. Weekly activities complement the sustained mentored research component. The first activity is curated around responsible conduct of research, addressing both technical mastery and the ethical, social, and legal implications of scientific work, while the second activity is a journal club, where students learn to dissect, interpret, and present cutting-edge peer-reviewed research literature. In the second term, students also receive dedicated training in scientific communication to present findings to a diverse audience. This fully residential program ensures seamless, round-the-clock access to laboratories—crucial for success in experimental life science research. Living on campus removes time and access barriers, allowing students to plan, monitor, and execute experiments without constraints, fostering deeper engagement, flexibility, and continuity in their research practice.

Aligned with Shiv Nadar IoE's commitment to interdisciplinary research and experiential learning, the department strives to cultivate a rigorous and reflective praxis within the arts. It actively engages with the intersections of technology, politics, identity, philosophy, history, society, materiality, and culture, fostering a holistic understanding of artistic practice in contemporary contexts. Towards this end, the department follows a philosophy that is learner-centric in which faculty and students will be peers working together in the production of knowledge through collaborative means as well as through systematic processes of persistent and layered enquiry. Also central to the idea of the department is a multidisciplinary and open-ended environment where our students can chart their own course of study as critical and self-reflexive scholars and practitioners. The department is also committed to providing its students and members with several options for financial aid as well as research grants. Admission to the MFA program is highly selective. The department conducts a review of the application forms which is followed by a personal interview for the shortlisted candidates. The MFA is a two-year (4 semester) practice-based and research-centric program. In special cases recommended by the mentors, the program can be extended to an additional semester. It is also mandatory for students with a 4/5 year diploma to complete 5 semesters with an extra emphasis on visual art theory. Entry Qualifications The focus of the program is on research, experimentation and on cultivating innovative art practices with expert artistic, theoretical and technical support. Individuals displaying a disposition towards deepening, broadening and accelerating their growth as professionals, individually and socially, with the desire to take their creative development to newer levels will make for suitable candidates. The focus of the program will be on research, experimentation and on cultivating innovative art practices with expert artistic, theoretical and technical support. The minimum entry qualifications for the MFA programme are: A BFA /BA degree or equivalent qualifications. Applicants must also have a portfolio of work demonstrating the necessary skills and aptitude. Applications from international students with relevant qualifications will be welcomed. Candidates from related fields such as Communication/ Design/ Applied Art will be considered on the basis of their portfolio, aptitude, approach and performance during the interview. Candidates from other backgrounds will be considered on the same basis. A student having a diploma in an equivalent stream may also be admitted on merit for a Masters’ degree program. However, they will have to complete 12 extra credits over and above the required 3 number of 64 Credits. These courses may be taken from art theory, seminar or art history courses being offered each semester. These credits can be taken concurrently with the MFA program and may be completed within the two year period or an extra semester may be taken to complete the above (Under UGC guidelines for admissions para 2.1) Course structure A student must complete a minimum of 64 credit hours in residence at the department. In the case of students participating in exchange programs with accredited institutions in the country or abroad, a transfer of up to 15 credits is permissible. Core Courses Number of Courses Credits Practice Core 4 16 Theory Core 4 16 Practice Electives 6 24 Electives 2 08 16 Courses 64 credits Students have to complete 4 core practice, 4 core theory courses and 8 elective courses in 4 semesters. A minimum of one core theory and two core practice courses have to be taken in the first two semesters (each course is 4 credits). Practice Courses Guidance in the practical aspects of art-making will be offered in the individual studios and workshops. The central strategy would be practice-based teaching and learning with emphasis on personal contact with faculty and peers. Studio spaces are meant primarily for experimentation, execution and finishing of artworks and informal peer- assisted learning. A sample of practice courses offered would be: • Painting & Drawing/Cross Media Project • Sculpture & Installation • The Photographic Image • The Moving Image: Form and Function • The Artist’s Body • Graphos: Writing the Visual • Artist’s Film & Video • Art in the Public Domain • Aesthetics and Politics • Independent Study\* 4 \* Independent study prioritizes individual research and students are expected to focus on their individual specialization, to deepen their investigations and consolidate the learning and experimentation of the first year under the supervision of a mentor. Theory Courses The core theory courses of the program are distributed across the four semesters. The program envisions a continuum between theory and practice and encourages students to develop a sustainable ‘praxis’ which is historically, and critically informed. To this end, the theory courses are intended to enhance critical thinking and developing a discursive approach to art making. The four core courses are: • Approaches to Art: Themes and Theories • Modernity, Modernisation, Modernism • Art after Independence • Art after World War-II Induction Courses To familiarize students with various media (hardware and software) induction courses will be conducted by the respective technicians of the wood, metal and digital media labs and occasionally by the faculty. Students who wish to acquire or explore specific skills will be given the necessary guidance. Induction courses have no credits. Theory would be taught mostly in English, applicants lacking an adequate knowledge of the language will have to take a course in Reading, Writing and Comprehension, offered by the Writing Centre. Project Spaces Working in project spaces allows the student to negotiate unconventional spaces for conceptualizing and displaying site-specific works. There will be available diverse spaces at the MFA Studios and around the Shiv Nadar IoE campus, distinctly different in dimensions and character, which will function as project spaces. In the second and third semester it will be mandatory for students to present the project undertaken during their chosen course/s at one of the project spaces. These projects will be executed during each of the semesters. Each project will be on display for one week. The allocation of spaces would be decided following a critique by faculty and peers from proposals submitted individually and collaboratively. Final Thesis Solo Show/ Project In the fourth semester, the students complete their Master’s project with a solo presentation of their work in an exhibition at the University gallery. Mentorship Each student will be assigned a mentor and one other mentor chosen by the students’ in accordance with the thrust and nuances of their individual practice, to help chart a course of study in keeping 5 with their individual methods, media, and work preferences. In exceptional cases, a request for a change of mentor/s would be considered in consultation with the faculty. However, the mentor team that would facilitate research and work of the student until the final exhibition/thesis would be designated as the Mentor Team no later than the end of the 2nd semester. The mentor team will comprise of: a. Mentor 1 (Practice) b. Mentor 2 (Preferably Art Theory) Assessment Performance will be assessed on the basis of separate projects that will be submitted for final assessment as a body of work at the end of each course, when it will be given a summative grade. Work done during the courses will also be reviewed through individual as well as collective critiques resulting in a cumulative grade. Critiques would help develop an individual vocabulary while exploring the processes, materials and ideas that a student wishes to address. Students present their work, or some part of their work, in a pre-designated room/space for a collective critique. In cases where transportation of the work is difficult due to fragility/size/weight etc., the mentor team may conduct the collective/individual critique at the student’s studio. Assessment of seminar courses will be on the basis of presentations and assignments submitted. They will be appraised on the basis of the understanding and distillation of theoretical concepts and contemporary discourse. The requirements for the award of the MFA degree include a portfolio of work done during the 4 semesters and a Fine Art Graduate Thesis Exhibition. The latter involves presenting a substantial body of original work in an exhibition space or at an appropriate site. Students are also required to appear for a viva voce to defend their work to faculty other than their mentor team. Theoretical assessments will be based on assignments submitted and the level of participation in class. Attendance through the four semesters will also be considered since personal contact and peer learning are fundamental to the teaching and learning methodology. In addition, students will be required to maintain a log (in whichever form preferred by the student and acceptable to the mentor) as evidence of the research carried out for the Masters project/ the Fine Art Graduate Thesis Exhibition. Tuition and financial aid All admitted students are eligible to apply for one need-based tuition fee waiver. Scholarships and Fellowships may be terminated if a student’s academic performance does not meet the standards set by the university/department. On losing his/her scholarship, a student is required to pay full fees as applicable at the time. Teaching Assistantship The department offers paid Teaching Assistantships for up to 2 students per batch. The TA is works under the supervision of the assigned faculty and is expected to support the faculty with the general instructional process, lab maintenance as well as the documentation/ archival activities of the department. 6 Hostel Facilities The MFA program at Shiv Nadar IoE is fully residential.

Students will expand their understanding of art historical methods, beyond iconographic, stylistic and formal analyses of artworks. As the first theoretical course of the M.F.A. programme, it will provide a foundation for students to deepen their understanding of art history and theory, preparing them for subsequent courses. The course will progress along two tracks of reflection and engagement. The first track will offer a critical reading of art history’s beginnings as a discipline. Students will be encouraged to understand the scope of the discipline and the gradual expansion of its ambit, in terms of ‘other’ cultures, and subjectivities, as well as varied disciplinary approaches. The second track will take students through a range of terms that are critical for art history today. The terms will include those which have gained currency in art history today, (e.g. identity) as well as those critical to art history’s disciplinary formation, (e.g. genre). The course format breaks away from the emphasis on specific art historical movements to equip students with a set of critical art historical methods. ART 603: Modernity, Modernisation, Modernism Course Description This course surveys the 19th and early 20th century, a period defined by industrial capitalism and imperialism, ending with the founding of independent nations, emerging from formerly colonised territories. Metropolitan, and colonial histories will be read contrapuntally— taking into account the imbricated, constitutive, and generative nature of both. Students will begin the course by examining the foundational relationship between modernity (and its resultant institutions and forms of life) and colonialism. Key themes (mentioned below) that frame the modernist work of art— epistemologically, discursively, and institutionally— will serve as the ground from which to undertake this task of decentring modernism. Artistic movements commonly understood as constituting (western) modernism will be discussed, and contextualized; these will be interspersed with broadly co-temporal developments in South Asia. In the final part of the course, the national modern, framed by movements of self-determination will be introduced. Some key themes that will be considered in the course include: Modernity, Modernism and the ‘World’, Art in/as an Institution: Galleries and Museums, Patrons and Citizens/Subjects, Vision in Modernity: With a lens, and without, Modernity and the framing of ‘Nature’, Primitivism: Objects, and Peoples, Material and Form I (1870s- WW1): Company Painting, Academic art and the colony, Realism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, Abstraction, Cubism, Suprematism, Material and Form II (Interwar period): Dadaism, Surrealism, The National Modern. 13 ART 604: Art after World War -II Course Description Moving away from the art historical dominance of American abstract expressionism versus Soviet Realism, this course explores the breadth of the Post War art from the postcolonial nations. The course will explore various strategies such as collaboration, institutional critique, feminism, decolonization, curatorial, public interventions, etc. used by contemporary artists. A range of diverse examples from Asia, Africa and Latin America will be examined. ART 605: Indian Art after Independence Course Description As an advanced theoretical core course, ART 605 will consider an array of artistic practices which emerged in independent India, spanning the early-twentieth century to the post-liberalization years. Students are expected to build upon the foundation established in ART 604, wherein the interconnections between modernism and modernity, and between modernity and colonialism were discussed in detail. The course encourages students to consider the debates around modernism in the context of an independent nation, as well as the concept of global modernisms. The course will encourage students’ reflection on the continuities as well as breaks with the colonial past. It will examine the interrelated nature of artistic practices, institutions, pedagogies, and subjectivities. In examining the works and location of individual artists, a point of emphasis will be institutions of art and culture, in post-independence India, within which these artists were situated. Students will annotate the relationship between artists and institutions, and the emergent tensions of the process, including the gate-keeping function of institutions. In effect, the course familiarizes students with the variegated terrain which established the subjectivity of the ‘Indian artist,’ simultaneously annotating how this subjectivity stood apart from other cultural practices. ART 620: Sculpture and Installation Course Description The course lays emphasis on the advancement of individual students’ concerns and engagements. Students will work in three dimensional space integrating sound/ mechanics/ new media etc. They will deal with making objects by carving/ assembling/ ready-mades. Students develop their practice benefiting from one on one critiques with mentors as well as joint student critiques. Intra and inter school cross-disciplinary collaborations will be encouraged. Visits to museums, galleries and artist studios and analysing works will form part of the course. Students will have the ability to make work of a high professional standard, with in-depth application, grasp and perception of their specialization and an advanced level of individual responsibility towards creative, technical and organizational skills. Students will develop the intellectual capacity to research, plan, design, fabricate, and complete work utilizing a variety of processes in a variety of settings for a number of purposes. 14 ART 609: Cross-Media Project Course Description The Cross-Media project aims at expanding the scope of individual practice to include areas of collective socio-cultural and political interest, through cultivating an active awareness of being located within a landscape and among communities. Instruction is specific to the needs of individual students and their orientations in terms of medium – traditional or otherwise - and language. The course involves field trips related to local histories/sites, carried out with a range of investigative visual media followed by periodic individual and group critiques. It is believed that these explorations could, apart from exposing and sensitizing students to the multiple realities that surround them, create practices that would go beyond the self-reflexive nature of an exclusive ‘art school’ language. Students would be encouraged to re-imagine cultural and economic frameworks for practice, either collectively, individually or through institutional/organizational affiliations; there is a need at the present time to re-create and extend contexts and agencies for art and its supporting structures. The notion of Praxis is central to the module, and the emphasis is on finding a grammar that binds medium, concept and subject-matter in an integrated approach to the excavation of meaning. Theoretical support that could expand and enrich the field of inquiry would be provided by core/visiting faculty and by other departments. At the end of the semester, students are expected to have a body of work which combines their individual expressions with their experiences in the field. ART 632: The Photographic Image Course Description This course explores through practice, the historical, expressive, critical, representational, formal, conceptual and technical aspects of this very varied, fluid, and pervasive medium through experimentation and research within the student’s own practice as a means of personal expression. An ‘aesthetically’ based medium, photography, will be explored and discussed along with reading into the practice and work of other artists who use photographic lens directly or as an take off point. Some potential subjects discussed will be appropriation, authenticity, truth, documentary, archive, quality, performativity and transcendence. Also discussed will be some of the following: the problems of making judgments and issues of quality; the content of art and photography; the shifts in the definitions of 'mainstream,' and ‘outsider, ‘and the role of the photographic image. 15 ART 652: The Moving Image: Form and Function Course Description This core course offers a critical examination of various forms of moving images in contemporary visual culture (including cinema, expanded film, and video art). The course introduces students to current media practices and discursive frameworks familiarising them with the historical, political and social context of the mediated image within critical art practice. In an era where the moving image is available at the swipe of a cell phone screen, it is imperative for art students to develop a keen insight into contemporary practices that produce expanded media forms. How have TikTok and Instagram Reels changed moving image cultures across the globe and how does an artist respond to this shift? ART 652 will be taught through a mix of lectures, workshops, screenings and discussions, and students are expected to develop minor media practices, work on an independent project in moving image, while at the same time the course aims to bring the digital media image into conversation with fine art practices such as drawing, painting and sculpture. ART 671: Art in the Public Domain Course Description This course attempts to generate critical, historically reflective, and socio-politically conscious art practice within a broad parameter of creative engagement in public domain. In this primarily practice based course, parallel theoretical association will be developed as per individual student projects. Considering social art practice in the multiplicity of possibilities, this course encourages interdisciplinary, non-instrumental, collaborative, community based, dialogic, participatory modes, bearing in mind discourses of relational aesthetics and other critical modes of framing and engagement with “public domain”. What are the possibilities of using the dialogue embodied in participatory and collaborative art making to create more co-authored works of art and how might an expanded notion of 'the artwork' as well as a distributed sense of 'the artist's identity/subjectivity' support one’s own cultural production? Such an approach also calls for engaging with the existing issues of censorship, dissent, protest, and resistance in the domain of socio-cultural politics, with an attempt to rethink and re-strategize familiar notions of art practices. The course could involve travelling and field work to realize in-situ projects. Students are expected to critically engage with the reading material, participate in discussions, conduct site visits, interviews, collaborate and think collaboratively. Students are required to maintain journals to keep notes; record their ideas, and document various stages of their projects. Students will take a critical, assertive, and self- reflective journey throughout the course which will culminate into a self-sufficient body of work, intervention, action, analytical documentation of observation. They will devise strategies to develop/curate their exhibitions (site specific, performative or other creative modes of display/sharing), presentations or a series of displays. This course will be structurally connected with other core and elective courses to create an interdisciplinary mode of study. 16 ART 662: Performance Resistance Course Description The course focuses on generating an inter-disciplinary peek into some key terminology, practices, and debates in dance, theatre, performance art, sound, installation art, and others. Theoretical and artistic reflections, the course, within the contemporary discourses on performance as a mode of political resistance and social justice will be examined. The pedagogic approach of the course emerges from locating body as the site of discursive action, while borrowing scholarship from critical dance studies, theatre and performance studies, gender studies, and political philosophy. ART 646: Art, Film and the Photographic Image Course Description Aesthetically based medium of film will be explored and discussed through the practices of photography and cinema. A reading into the work of filmmakers and artists who have explored ideas of time and memory will form an important aspect of the course. Along with a critical reading of the work of filmmakers and artists who have been influenced by or who appropriate found footage/stills directly or indirectly within the frame of pain, grief and desire. The course will also bring into conversation the relation between film and digital image making practices in the contemporary. Important feature films will be shown in class and students asked to respond to the works by executing visual projects either as stills or videos or any other medium/ form of their choice. This course will encourage students to explore expressive, critical, representational, formal, conceptual and technical aspects of these very varied, fluid, and pervasive mediums of film and digital image. The course aims to support unconventional experimentation and research complementing the student’s own practice, as a means of personal expression. ART 673: Art + Ecology Course Description Art + Ecology is an interdisciplinary, research-based course engaging contemporary art practices. Graduate students shall develop land and cultural literacy with a conceptual foundation in field based research art making and a wide range of production skills, including sculpture, installation, social practice, and new/digital media. Advanced coursework includes working on and in various collaborative and interdisciplinary fields with departments across SNU from environmental engineering, economics, anthropology, sociology, and natural sciences. The Art + Ecology course will encourage students to investigate, question, and expand upon inter-relationships between natural and cultural systems. Art will be viewed as an agent of analysis, critique and radical change. The course would be less bound to traditional media and is towards to stimulating ideas and new forms of public engagement and aesthetic experience in the public domain. 17 ART 619: Graphos:Writing the Visual Course Description Graphos is not limited to graphic novels, comics etc. It can take any narrative form linear or nonlinear. Historically text and image relation are integral part of art practice. From religious scripture to advertisement, visual communication to political propaganda, subtitle on moving image to different other past/present/futuristic art forms where text and image/text on image/image after image/image on image/sound over image has been producing different ways of understating/reading/viewing/listening. This course offers listicles or in few cases (according to students’ enquiry) through study of different ways in which text and image relation in art making helps practitioner to express complex ideas. Apart from looking visual experimentation this course will look upon few critical pieces in literature from magical realism to contemporary poets from Indian different subcontinents. This course aims to open creative expression in which students can identify different modes to explore complex ideas. Ideas related to a student's own area of artistic enquiry, empirical experience, existing narrative (oral/written) and any narrative form that they think is an urgency to express. Intention behind this course is to create a discursive classroom environment where students who are becoming art professionals can think differently, collectively to express their artistic concern. However, this course primarily focuses on narrative construction through text and image. ART 656: Interactive Art Course Description Interactive Art is a dynamic, interdisciplinary, ideas-driven course. This course allows students to focus on their interest in painting, sculpture, music, installation or performance, and explore ideas, materials, media and processes that extend their practice into the realm of interactivity. Students will learn to engage the spectator through various modes of interactivity, allowing for navigation, assembly, and contribution to an artwork that goes far beyond the purely psychological activity. The course will investigate how interactivity in Interactive Art produces meaning. Students will be introduced to aesthetics and politics of Interactive Art. Through studying instances like change- paintings, and genres in kinetic sculptures, gaming, responsive environments, and digital cultures, students will be oriented to the modern history of interactive art. The course will provide hands- on experience with electronics, circuits, sensors, & programming to gain understanding of the general usages of equipment involved in building interactive systems. Through a carefully mentored series of tutorials, led by a diverse set of experts in the field, students will be encouraged to learn a range of practical skills supported by workshop facilities, test-builds, and guided tutorials. Finally, students will be encouraged to define the contexts of their working practice, be that in art, design or any other field, in which they may create a work of Interactive Art, as gallery- based work, performance, as part of a virtual platform or in the public realm. The students will be expected to present their choice of project, or reflections on their own practice. Articulation through speaking and writing will be required throughout the course. 18 ART 701: Introduction to Artistic Research Course Description Research has always been an essential aspect of the artistic process – but it is only in recent times that it has emerged as a systematic area of enquiry. This has led to exciting debates about the nature and scope of artistic research, about why artists should care about research at all and most importantly, how it creates a space for “non-discursive forms of knowledge” (Borgdorff, 2012). By embracing a wide variety of knowing and understanding, it contributes to an inclusive and comprehensive knowledge ecosystem. It also emerges from a growing recognition that it is important for artists and practitioners to produce accounts of practice as these are different from those produced by purely an academic study. The Introduction to Artistic Research course will familiarise students with current debates in the field, encompassing key themes and concepts. It will provide them with a context to explore the relationship between practice and theory, and to discover ways in which they come together to produce new forms of thinking and making. Students will develop methods of inquiry that emerge from their material practice. The course will support experimental approaches to art practice, fostering a spirit of inquiry and critical reflection. The course will introduce students to contemporary research methods, philosophies and paradigms. It will provide an opportunity for students to cultivate a meaningful relation to research in relation to their own artistic practice. They will acquire essential skills to conduct an independent research project, making it relevant for those who may wish to pursue a doctoral program in future. However, the course is primarily designed for practitioner students who would like to incorporate a formal research approach into contemporary art practice. Through an engagement with a wide set of practice-based process, students will encounter the work of other artist-researchers, and sharpen their awareness of theoretical frameworks, critically engage with their own work, and contribute to a broader discourse within the arts and academia. \*\*\* 19

As an undergraduate student (2016–2020), I had the opportunity to learn history from some of the best practitioners of the discipline. As someone who had no humanities background in school, the faculty members, with the utmost care and attention, cultivated in me and many others the critical sensibilities and dispositions required to acknowledge and appreciate the complexities of the past. The history curriculum at Shiv Nadar IoE is distinct from most of the undergraduate history programmes offered in India. Students are trained not only in history but also in disciplines such as archaeology and museum studies. This allowed me to question narrow, artificial chronological labels such ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’ and ‘modern institutionalised by history departments across India, and think of the past from different vantage points. Disciplines such as archaeology equipped me with tools and methodologies to visualise and imagine our deep past. Similarly, Museum Studies provided me with an axis to think about categories as broad as culture, politics, and economy through the politics of objects. It is because of this training that I decided to pursue the discipline for my higher education. In the end, I would say what I appreciate most about the department is not only the rigour they bring to their teaching but also the way they cater to the needs of each student when it comes to learning. This is the reason why I decided to come back to the department to pursue a Ph.D. in history.

We are also one of the few universities that hosts an Archaeology lab for undergraduate and doctoral students. There is no escaping the past, but how do we understand it? What is heritage? Who gets to choose and decide what becomes heritage? How does archaeology investigate climate change in the past? Does Archaeology and History only serve a public good? These key questions, among others, will be addressed through a learning-by-doing approach. In this Major, students will explore various themes through hands-on training with the latest archaeological field and laboratory 14 methods, protocols of collections management, understanding of archival work, and independent research projects. Through on-site lectures, you will engage with material and collections-based research and develop critical and reflexive approaches. These will enable a foundational and critical understanding about material and non-material pasts. Drawing on the latest methods, you will also be introduced to specialized subfields such as urban, environment, economic, and social histories of South Asia and beyond, across regions and periods. With the coming together of Archaeology and History, students will be immersed in classroom learning, archival research, and field training. You will be equipped to raise analytical questions, undertake rigorous research projects, tell stories through diverse media, and intervene in policy dialogues. You can flourish in careers in public policy, archaeology, historical research, museum studies, archiving, cultural heritage, policy, journalism, academia, media, diplomacy, tourism development, and administration.

This Major will help students ask some of the 18 most pertinent questions of our times like, how has the history of science shaped the world we live in today and do technologies exacerbate social problems or help us address them? The Major also entails an immersive understanding of science, technology, and society with a carefully curated set of courses that explore real-world social contexts. Understanding how science and technology both emerge from and operate within particular social contexts is crucial to analyze the challenges, impact, and potential of technological developments. The overall intention of the major is to train and inform students about how cultures, customs, and social life are impacted and shaped by scientific developments and technological innovation, as much as how social forces impact these developments and innovations.

As an undergraduate student (2016–2020), I had the opportunity to learn history from some of the best practitioners of the discipline. As someone who had no humanities background in school, the faculty members, with the utmost care and attention, cultivated in me and many others the critical sensibilities and dispositions required to acknowledge and appreciate the complexities of the past. The history curriculum at Shiv Nadar IoE is distinct from most of the undergraduate history programmes offered in India. Students are trained not only in history but also in disciplines such as archaeology and museum studies. This allowed me to question narrow, artificial chronological labels such ‘ancient’, ‘medieval’ and ‘modern institutionalised by history departments across India, and think of the past from different vantage points. Disciplines such as archaeology equipped me with tools and methodologies to visualise and imagine our deep past. Similarly, Museum Studies provided me with an axis to think about categories as broad as culture, politics, and economy through the politics of objects. It is because of this training that I decided to pursue the discipline for my higher education. In the end, I would say what I appreciate most about the department is not only the rigour they bring to their teaching but also the way they cater to the needs of each student when it comes to learning. This is the reason why I decided to come back to the department to pursue a Ph.D. in history.

Abhishek Kishor (ME-2024 batch): Garland Duncan Scholarship ($5,000), ASME Foundation Scholarship ($2,000). b. Sanjana Ashok Iyer (ME-2024 batch): ASME Founda- tion Variable Scholarship ($2,000). Interdisciplinary Aspect Interdisciplinary research is at the core of the Mechanical Engineering Department. Our primary aim is to devise environment-friendly and sustainable solutions for engineering systems to address rising environmental concerns and deterioration of natural resources. These solutions require an interdisciplinary approach owing to the complex interlinkages of these issues. One of the groups in the department is working on a highly interdisciplinary research theme: High-performance energy storage and conversion devices through severe physical deformation. The research aims to design and develop electrochemical energy storage devices, including supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. In addition, the group is also actively working on developing highly efficient catalysts for green hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting. Another group works on environmental protection via bioinspired approaches and green technologies. Different technological challenges this group addresses include the development of self-cleaning solutions through environment-friendly technologies and waste products, designing and developing a desalination process using clean/green energy and machine learning to solve fluid-based energy optimisation problems. Another group of faculties from design specialisation works on aerospace applications, biological systems, use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) towards assimilating large data sets. Indeed, one of the central focus of this group has been towards the non-linear dynamic analysis of aeroelastic systems, and in turn, augmenting a safe design and operational paradigms for the same. Interestingly, non-linear dynamics of aeroelastic systems are also well-suited to describe several biological/physiological applications, such as leaf flutter and dynamics of vocal folds, and have also been gaining focus over recent times. Similarly, the mechanics of advanced functionally graded materials (FGMs) have also been a focal topic of research, wherein the applications range from traditional mechanical systems to augmenting very slender wing structures for wind turbine blades and micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) and medical applications like implant/stent design. All of the above, from non-linear dynamical analysis to FGMs, require enormous data sets and depend on massive computational efforts or demanding experimental techniques. To address this concern, we've been devoting attention towards using ML or AI algorithms for both (a) to augment the understanding behind the physics of the problem and (b) towards prognostics and similar engineering applications. Curriculum The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Shiv Nadar University has a dynamic curriculum and is revised regularly to incorporate recent industry and research developments. Great emphasis is to the objective-based learning and hands-on training with a core motive to develop and improve students' skill sets. Currently, the department successfully runs the B.

School of Natural Sciences About the Department: Chemistry education at SNIoE provides a link between the fundamental principles governing the nature of the universe and the science of life, and spans traditional as well as a variety of inter-disciplinary areas. Chemistry, often referred as the central science, as it plays a vital role in nearly every other scientific field. At the undergraduate level, we offer B.Sc. (Research) in Chemistry. One can also combine a Minor in Chemistry with a Major in any other discipline at SNIoE and vice versa. University-wide elective courses in the curriculum allow students unprecedented freedom to explore subjects outside their chosen major; in some depth. This flexible and broad curriculum prepares students not just for a career in chemistry upon graduation, but for a leadership role in the world as well. The Undergraduate Chemistry Experience The chemistry curriculum at SNIoE provides both a broad background in chemical principles as well as in-depth study of chemistry or chemistry-related areas that build on this background. The chemistry curriculum is divided into three categories: introductory general chemistry, foundation courses providing breadth across sub- disciplines, and rigorous in-depth courses that build upon these foundations and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Since chemistry is an experimental science, substantial laboratory work is an integral part of almost all our courses. The introductory general chemistry course provides a common grounding in basic chemical concepts for students with diverse backgrounds, develops basic mathematical and laboratory skills, and prepares students for the foundation courses. Foundation courses in general chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry provide breadth and lay the groundwork for more in-depth course work. Laboratory Experience The chemistry laboratory experience at SNIoE includes synthesis of molecules; measurement of chemical properties, structures, and phenomena; hands-on experience with modern analytical instrumentation; and computational data analysis and modeling. All laboratory programs are conducted in a safe environment that includes adherence to national; and state regulations regarding hazardous waste management and laboratory safety including, facilities for chemical waste disposal, safety information and reference materials, and personal protective equipment available to all students and faculty. The chemistry laboratories at SNIoE are equipped with functioning fume hoods, safety showers, eyewashes, first aid kits, and fire extinguishers are readily available. Students are trained in modern chemical safety, to understand responsible disposal techniques, understand and comply with safety regulations, understand and use material safety data sheets (MSDS), recognize and minimize potential chemical and physical hazards in the laboratory, and know how to prevent and ability to handle laboratory emergencies effectively. Problem-Solving Skills As part of the SNIoE experience, students are expected to develop the ability to define problems, develop testable hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze data using statistical methods, and draw appropriate conclusions. The chemistry curriculum provides ample opportunities for developing both written and oral communication skills, as well as team skills. Our instructional programs incorporate team experiences in classroom and laboratory components of the chemistry curriculum. Post-Graduate Programs At the postgraduate level, SNIoE offers the following programs: Integrated B.Sc.-M.Sc. (Research), Integrated B.Sc.-M.Sc.-Ph.D., M.Sc. (Research), Integrated M.Sc.-Ph.D. and Ph.D. in chemistry. Foundation courses in the first semester ensure that all students, irrespective of the specialization, possess the requisite background to complete the course of study and benefit fully from the program. The integrated programs and the Ph.D. program in chemistry at SNU consists of a rigorous regimen of both broad-based and in-depth course work, development of project proposals, research and literature seminars, in-depth dissertation research under the supervision of a research advisor, and a public thesis defense. Chemistry Careers Chemistry offers good career opportunities for high quality graduates, in industry as well as in academia, in developed markets in India and abroad such as the US, Europe, Japan and Australia - the major employers being: industries related to agricultural technology, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and materials. IT industries working on artificial intelligence and related platforms do provide solutions to life sciences, biotechnology and health-care sectors; as well as R & D institutes and academia. Furthermore, chemists find job opportunities in various other sectors such as chemical industry, and advancement of career opportunities in forensic, food science and as health professionals. Chemistry Research at SNIoE Research activities are not confined to post-graduate level, but are integrated into the under-graduate program at SNIoE through various lab-related components and possibility using Research Experiential & Applied Learning (REAL) course platform too. Undergraduate research allows students to realize and reinforce chemistry knowledge from their formal course work. It also assists in developing their scientific and professional skills, and create acumen towards answering out of the box questions. Original research culminating in a comprehensive written report provides an effective pedogogical means for integrating undergraduate learning experiences, and allows students to participate directly in the process of learning. Opportunities for research in chemistry at SNIoE are available in the following broad areas:  Bio-inorganic Chemistry  Medicinal Chemistry  Catalysis  Metalloradical Chemistry  Chemical Biology  Nano-Biotechnology  Cheminformatics  Photoelectrochemistry  Computational Quantum Chemistry  Polymer Chemistry  Chemical & Biology Crystallography  Protein Chemistry  Green Chemistry  Supramolecular Chemistry  Materials Chemistry  Synthetic Organic Chemistry  Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Chemical The specific research areas covered in the department can be found out from the departmental website: Dynamics (https://chemistry.snu.edu.in/research/areas-research). Major in Chemistry The basic undergraduate degree program offered by the Department of Chemistry is the Bachelor of Science: B.Sc. (Research) in Chemistry. In addition, Department of Chemistry is also offering specialization in Material Chemistry, Computational Chemistry and Chemical Biology in B.Sc. (Research) program (with Specialization).

D E EPARTMENT OF CONOMICS SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES Undergraduate Prospectus 2021-22 Bachelor of Science (Research) Economics CONTACT INFORMATION: Department of Economics, P.O. Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida Pin: 201314 Contact: Ms. Shubra Chetan (Programme Manager) +91-120-7170100 econug@snu.edu.in/ shubra.chetan@snu.edu.in 2 3 Economics at SNU Modern economics, which has its origins in political economy, has vastly expanded in scope from its core areas of study of markets and the overall economy. With its emphasis on understanding how individuals, groups, and societies decide to employ limited resources in an increasingly inter-dependent world, economics provides for powerful tools for analysing not only economic interactions but also understanding social and cultural phenomena. In designing policies and mechanisms to promote organizational or societal outcomes that are feasible, valuable, sustainable, and efficient, modern economics has made significant contributions in deepening our understanding and framing policies that affect various facets of life and society society -- businesses, finance, industry, politics, public policy evaluation and implementation, social issues -- and the economy at large. The Department of Economics at Shiv Nadar University is one of the premier Economics departments in India. Established in 2012, it has quickly established its reputation as one of the leading centres of Economics education and research. The department is comprised of faculty who have an active research agenda in various sub-disciplines in economics including economic theory, macroeconomics, development economics, environmental economics, international trade, labour economics, health economics, public economics and finance. Currently, the department offers an undergraduate major and an undergraduate minor in Economics. The Undergraduate Major in Economics Our B.Sc. (Research) program is one of a kind in India. The core strength of the program is drawn from the faculty members it will be taught by, who are active researchers in their respective fields. To the extent possible, courses include independent research components in the form of term papers, presentations etc. Our B.Sc. (Research) degree is designed to be comparable to internationally acclaimed programs, and combines rigorous training with flexibility in choice of elective courses. The aim is to produce students who are ready for opportunities in the market: be it jobs in the corporate sector, public sector, non-governmental/social sector or a desire to pursue higher studies in economics or related disciplines. Programme structure: Economics training at SNU aims to provide students with a thorough understanding of the core areas in economics followed by instruction in sub fields of the student’s own choosing in the final years. Students will also have to finish an undergraduate thesis project as part of the programme. The students can choose from a wide range of sub fields including, but not limited to, game theory and industrial organization, development economics, political economy, public economics, environmental economics, macroeconomics, international trade, labour economics, money and banking etc. To graduate with a Major in Economics, each student needs at least 108 credits in Major courses and 42 credits in UWE (University-wide-elective) and CCC (Common-course- curriculum) courses.

(3:1:0) SOC 102: Understanding Modernity Modernity has become a defining feature in contemporary societies. It marks the coming together over the centuries of philosophical principles and technological developments, the two trends strengthening each other. Through those means the modern human aims at freeing itself from the previous bounds of former beliefs in which human actions were defined and limited. Modernity defines itself as a point of departure from pre-existing societies and locates its genesis in the Renaissance and 18th century scientific investigative mind embodied by the encyclopedists. From the 19th century onwards, modernity has defined the core principles of policy making and philosophical debates or at least acted as the reference to define them. Stemming from modernity are notions such as the traditional, the folk, the backward, the classic, the pre-modern and the post-modern. It accompanies the building up of nation states and imposes a vision of society and humanity as well as a set of values. As such, it has driven societal choices but has also been the object of critique and questioning from the 19th to the 21st century. Modernity will be looked at both as a phenomenon and as a notion through multiples angles and perspectives with lectures by faculty from Sociology, Literature, History and Fine Arts departments. How does one locate him/herself in regard to modernity? Have humans defined themselves as master of their own destiny only in the modern period? Has modernity allowed humans to achieve their goals to free themselves from the bounds of beliefs? The notion won’t be looked at as only a western and recent concept. Other historical and cultural influences constitutive of modernity will also be considered.

Students will be rigorously taught how consumers maximize their preferences given their budgets to make optimal consumption decisions, which in turn are aggregated to form the industry demand. Again, firms choose technology and employ resources optimally to minimize costs, which give rise to the industry supply function. The industry demand and supply then interact in the context of different market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly, etc.) to determine market price and quantity in equilibrium, which give rise to consumer and producer surplus. The government may impose taxes or provide subsidies to alter these surpluses. Finally, general equilibrium analysis is invoked to analyse the behavior of multiple markets at the same time, and how a change in one affects the other.

The course begins by an introduction to the general equilibrium framework with the aim of developing the concepts of competitive equilibrium, and welfare theorems. This welfare theorems highlight how the concerns of efficiency and distribution can be viewed as distinct issues with in a competitive market economy framework. This will be followed by an analysis of externalitites and public goods -- these serve as canonical examples of situations where the market outcome may not be efficient, and might call for some form of market intervention and/or non-market mechanisms for allocation of resources. The course will equip students 12 to think deeply about functioning of markets, the conditions under which markets are efficient, conditions under which they might not be efficient, and types of intervention that may improve on market outcomes.

DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH 2025-26 Our Distinctive History Shiv Nadar University was established in 2011 by Mr. Shiv Nadar, one of Asia’s foremost philanthropists and a pioneer of the technological revolution in India. He is the Founder of HCL Tech, a $12.8 billion global organization with 223,438 professionals operating from 60 countries. Mr. Nadar’s philanthropic initiative, the Shiv Nadar Foundation set up in 1994, has so far invested close to $1 billion across institutions and initiatives spanning the entire spectrum of education and art, making it one of India’s largest philanthropic foundations. ANALYTICAL THINKING, PHYSICAL AND CREATIVITY, PROBLEM-SOLVING: EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING: with research programs, internships, a vibrant campus life on our entrepreneurial opportunities, and more, 286-acre green campus is our curriculum teaches key skills designed just for that ACADEMIC JOBS, HIGHER STUDIES EXCELLENCE: OR START-UPS: our faculty come from we prepare our students top institutions in India for a variety of aspirations and the world Why Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR Awards and Rankings Recognized as an National Institutional QS Asia Institution of Eminence Ranking Framework (NIRF) Ranking 2024 1 of the only 4 private universities Youngest university to be ranked among 41 in India; amongst top in the country to be designated as the top 100 of NIRF, 7 years in a row. 36% in Asia. an Institution of Eminence by the Government of India #1 India’s best young #7 Top Universities in university India #21 Biological Sciences #28 Chemistry (Careers 360, 2023 ranking of Careers 360, 2024 ranking of private universities) private and public universities) (Nature Index India 2023 ranking of Indian academic institutions) #3 Top private university in Awarded University of India the year 2024 (Emerging category Global Top 200; India Top 5 #5 Top private university under 15 years) SDG 6 and SDG 2: Times Higher for employability Impact Ranking 2023, 2024 10th FICCI Higher Education (Indian Institutional Ranking Framework Excellence Awards 2024 2024) Why Study English at Shiv Nadar University? The undergraduate program at the Department of English at Shiv Nadar IoE seeks to be contemporary while also remaining faithful to its traditional disciplinary identity. In addition, we are now congruent with the vision laid out in the New Education Policy (NEP). At the heart of our new English program is the commitment to reconstitute traditional literary categories in contemporary ways. We take the student through several pathways that include fictional traditions stretching from the novel to graphic novels and videogames, the literatures of South Asia, literary and cultural theory, world poetry, and the development of theatre from classical to contemporary. Moreover, the English program at Shiv Nadar University sees no contradiction between creative and expository writing. Every student is required to do a compulsory course in academic writing, but we also have creative writers among us who offer creative writing courses with a focus on prose fiction. In 2025 the Department of English will welcome Professor Sam North, an author who has been on the Booker Prize longlist, from the University of Exeter as our Visiting Professor for the calendar year. Among other courses, Professor North will offer an introductory course in screenwriting, which is another creative area in which the department plans to branch into in the future. The USPs of our program are as follows: The program is contemporary and exciting. It draws on methodological breakthroughs emerging from philosophy, anthropology, semiotics, and the exciting new knowledge systems of the IT world, to constitute itself as an inherently interdisciplinary program. The department has just introduced, as part of its revised curriculum, courses focused on the emerging literature on the posthuman, the Anthropocene, and Artificial Intelligence. Students receive personalized mentoring in the art of writing right through their four-year program. Students are challenged to write long academic essays and creative pieces as part of their coursework. A low student-to-faculty ratio, combined with ample tutoring resources, ensures constant feedback and personalized mentoring for the student. In addition to this, students may embark on a university-funded, extracurricular research project known as the Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR), wherein they are mentored by a faculty member of any department of their choice, on a topic of their choice. For example, in 2024, an English Major did an OUR project on dance with a professor from the Department of Art, Media, and Performance. The program embodies an expansive notion of literary studies. It draws on the exponential expansion of translation to decentre the ‘English’ in English literature and to treat the language as a means of mediating between literatures originating in various parts of the world. Our B.A. program has a strong research component. All fourth-year students are required to write an 8,000-word research paper, carrying the weight of 12 credits and based on a specific set of readings and one-on-one weekly consultations with a designated supervisor. The program is taught by one of the best Departments of English in India. Our faculty members have Ph.Ds. from universities such as the University of Oxford, Trinity College, Dublin, Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Binghamton University, SOAS University of London, University of East Anglia, EFLU Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, and Monash University. Highly regarded as scholars and writers, they have been published widely in India and abroad and featured at eminent conferences and literary festivals. They have also held several prestigious fellowships, grants and residencies. These include the Hawthornden Fellowship, the Andrew Mellon Fellowship at the Huntingdon Library, the Leverhulme Visiting Fellowship, the Vermont Studio Center Fellowship, the TORCH Women in the Humanities Fellowship, the Charles Wallace India Trust Fellowship, the DARIAH-EU Open Education Grant, the Rockefeller Residency at the Bellagio Center and the Can Serrat Art Center Residency, among others. Curriculum Our four-year B.A. (Research) in English program is designed to meet the following objectives: • to ensure that the student’s progression through the courses is both logical and pedagogically effective; • to give the student a solid grounding in key movements in the history of English literature; • to give the student the maximum possible exposure to world literature as well as vernacular literature; • to introduce the student to multiple domains of specializations such as South Asian literary studies, translation studies, and creative writing; • to continuously mentor the student and help her acquire the skills and techniques of research, critical thinking, and writing. In the first year, the student does introductory, survey-level courses. These courses familiarize the student with the basics of literary analysis and interpretation, as well as, with the three broad genres of literary studies: poetry, prose, and drama. School-wide courses on the techniques of academic writing and on the foundations of modernity are also taken. The second year of our program introduces the student to the basics of linguistics and translation studies. Key movements in the history of English literature are also studied. The third year is marked by an increase in the number of “contemporary” and theoretical topics. During this year, the student also enrols in an introductory course in creative writing. The fourth year introduces a few more domains of literary research. These include feminism, vernacular literature, and folk literature. There is also a course on newer forms of fiction such as films, video games, and graphic novels. It is also in the fourth year that the student embarks on the year-long process of producing a research paper in which she is individually mentored by a faculty member. Department of English Faculty Our faculty is highly regarded with Ph.Ds. from distinguished universities such as the University of Oxford, Trinity College, Dublin, Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Binghamton University, SOAS University of London, University of East Anglia, EFLU Hyderabad, IIT Bombay, and Monash University. Our esteemed professors have been published widely in India and abroad and featured at eminent conferences and literary festivals. They have also held several prestigious fellowships, grants and residencies. These include the Hawthornden Fellowship, the Andrew Mellon Fellowship at the Huntington Library, the Leverhulme Visiting Fellowship, the Vermont Studio Center Fellowship, the TORCH Women in the Humanities Fellowship at the University of Oxford, the Charles Wallace India Trust Fellowship, the DARIAH-EU Open Education Grant, the Rockefeller Residency at the Bellagio Center and the Can Serrat Art Center Residency, among others. Postgraduate Courses The English Department offers a two-year M.A. program that enables the student to engage with depth and rigour in the discipline and includes a supervised 8000-word thesis to be written in the last semester. The department’s doctoral program comprises coursework and the completion of an 80,000-100,000- word thesis under expert supervision in a range of areas. All admitted M.A. and Ph.D. students are offered a stipend that enables them to carry out their research without financial stress. Academic Collaborations B.A. (Research) students can study a semester at an overseas university and then transfer the earned credits to the program they are pursuing at their parent institution. This is facilitated through collaborations between Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR’s International Office and several universities abroad. In the past, students from the Department of English have gone to study at the University of Guelph, Ontario University, AIESEC, and Deakin University. Other Activities The department conducts an annual short story writing competition for high school students called Crooked Lines. It receives hundreds of entries from all over the country. Rs 1 lakh is disbursed in prizes. The winner is announced at a literature festival on campus that includes eminent Indian and international writers. The department also houses the student-run literary magazine The Freewheeler which has completed ten years. In addition, there is the student literary club Trivium that organizes various literary activities on campus right through the academic year. OUR Program The Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR) program at Shiv Nadar University, Delhi NCR aims to give students hands-on experience in conducting research and doing independent work under faculty supervision. The OUR project runs for a year, is non-credited, and is provided ample funding by the University. The OUR may be carried out by the student in any discipline, not necessarily her Major. Every year, awards are given to the top three OUR projects in the University. In the past, students of the English Department have completed OUR projects with faculty members from the Departments of English, Sociology, and Economics. They have worked on topics as diverse as comparative linguistics, school education outcomes, morality in video games, stand-up comedy, and popular engagements with the law. Pathway to Progress Our undergraduate and postgraduate degrees are truly versatile. They have successfully enabled our students to enter a wide range of careers including academics, editing and publishing, media and communication, business administration, law, instructional design, art curation, public health, event management, and others. Many of our students have gone on to pursue M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in areas as diverse as literary studies, policy studies, media and communication, and business administration (MBA). They have gone on to secure admission in M.A. and Ph.D. programs at stellar institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, Arizona State University, Dartmouth College, University of Edinburgh, University of California, San Diego, University College, Dublin, University of Melbourne and others. Our alumni have gone on to work in reputed organizations such as Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG, Ogilvy PR Australia, Chase India, Centre for Policy Research, Azim Premji Foundation, HCL Technologies, Teach for India, Athena Education, Sage, and Oxford University Press, among others.

DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS SCHOOL OF NATURAL SCIENCES UNDERGRADUATE PHYSICS PROSPECTUS (For batches admitted on or after 2025) “I wanted most to give you some appreciation of the wonderful world and the physicist way of looking at it ... Perhaps you will not only have some appreciation of this culture; it is even possible that you may want to join in the greatest adventure that the human mind has ever begun." Richard P. Feynman in the Epilogue to the Feynman Lectures on Physics 1 PHYSICS It is a remarkable fact that all the phenomena we see around us, whether it is the red colour of the sunset or the light coming from the beginning of the universe, reflect the functioning of certain laws of nature. Physics is a human attempt to discover these laws and to study their consequences. What drives a physicist is the curiosity about nature and the fact that the answers to the various questions tie together in a beautiful pattern. It is also a fact that these attempts to understand the laws of nature have led to technological advances, and in turn these technological advances have provided physicist with new tools for understanding nature. This symbiosis of fundamental physics and technological advancements is one of the hallmarks of our civilization. Aim of the Physics Undergraduate Program Research-led undergraduate program in physics at SNU is designed for a student who either wishes to pursue a traditional/interdisciplinary research career in physics, or who wishes to use skills of a physicist to understand complex systems ranging from the earth's atmosphere to the human cell. The rigorous undergraduate program in physics, together with the multidisciplinary environment of SNU, will enable a student to engage creatively with problems that transcend the confines of any single discipline. The duration of B.Sc. (Research) in Physics is stipulated for 3 years (minimum) to 6 years (maximum). Learning Outcomes of the Physics Undergraduate Program • Students will demonstrate expertise in mathematical concepts essential for practicing physics. • Students will demonstrate understanding of Electromagnetism, Classical mechanics, Thermal physics, Quantum mechanics, and Statistical mechanics through problem solving, and will apply this knowledge to understand complex physical systems. • Students will exhibit experimental and computational skills acquired in laboratories through designing experiments, performing, and analyzing the measurements to draw rational conclusions. • Students should be capable of demonstrating scientific writing, oral presentation skills, critical thinking, and research methodology. 2 Highlights of the Physics Undergraduate Program Faculty The SNU Physics Department comprises of faculty members who are equally passionate about their research and teaching. They are keen to bring the excitement of discovery to the classroom and to involving students in their research. Their research interests range from nanotechnology to the beginning of the universe. Many of them have worked at some of the leading international research and academic institutions and continue to be involved in collaborative research with these institutions. Minor The department is committed to equipping students to meet the challenges that contemporary society faces in the areas of energy, environment, and economic development. Such training is facilitated by the possibility for a student to obtain a major in physics and a minor in another discipline of his or her interest. For example, a student who has a major in physics and a minor in economics would have very attractive job prospects in the financial and banking industry. Similarly, a student interested in quantum computing can major in physics and obtain a minor in mathematics. Laboratory The laboratory is an integral part of the physics program at SNU, not merely a supplement to the classroom teaching. It is the place for students to measure and explore the natural world. The salient feature of these programs is an innovative use of personal computers for data acquisition and analysis. Another important aspect is that labs will be project-based and curiosity-driven explorations, rather than simple repetition of standard experiments. Tutorial Program An essential part of learning physics is to apply abstract principles to concrete problems. With this in mind, most courses in physics will have an associated tutorial program. It is in the tutorial classes where the students will hone their skills as physicists, learning to make models, make crude estimates, and then solve the problem analytically or on a computer. It is also here that they will learn the skills of collaborative research. Undergraduate Thesis The goal of the physics program at SNU is to equip the students with skills to explore the unknown. The final year students will undertake a year-long research project, which will lead to their undergraduate thesis. The thesis will be supervised by one of the faculty members and will address a research problem. 3 Major in Physics The coursework for a student majoring in physics has three broad parts. The first part, which covers the initial two academic years, is focused on developing a firm foundation of the subject. In the second part, which is the third academic year, student learns about more advanced theoretical and experimental tools, often revisiting the concepts developed in the foundation part but viewing them using these sophisticated tools. At the end of the 4th semester, the student will be able to appreciate and explore open research problems in physics; therefore in the final year, the student will take electives from a wide range of courses, often related to the research interests of the faculty, and will start research work for his or her undergraduate thesis. Apart from the physics course, a physics major student is expected to take a broad range of courses from natural sciences, engineering, humanities, and social sciences. These courses fall in the following categories: University-wide electives (UWE), Core common curriculum (CCC), Research, experiential and applied learning (REAL), Values, ethics, leadership and service (VELS). The Physics undergraduate advisor will assist all the students in meeting the various departmental and university requirements. Credit Requirements for Physics Major Core Courses: Within the duration of the UG program, a student is expected to complete 109 credits of core courses, out of which 12 credits are expected to be achieved through physics elective courses. UWE: Within the duration of the UG program, a student is expected to complete a minimum of 18 credits of UWE offered by other departments of science, engineering, and humanities. CCC: Within the duration of the UG program, a student is expected to complete a minimum of 18 credits of CCC courses offered by all the departments of science, engineering, and humanities. However, the sum of CCC and UWE must be 42 credits. REAL: Within the duration of the UG program, a student is expected to complete 25 credits from courses having research and experimental learning components. VELS: Within the duration of the UG program, a student should complete 18 credits for VELS components. 4 An example of a flexible course organization for B.Sc.

A minor in physics has two aspects to it. First, it ensures that a student is well versed with the core of physics, and secondly, it will allow the students to learn more advanced aspects of the subject according to their interests. A minor in physics will equip a student to engage in challenging multidisciplinary problems. It will be equally valuable for students seeking employment in industry or finance, where a physicist’s skills of making quantitative models of complex situations are welcomed.

Perhaps you will not only have some appreciation of this culture; it is even possible that you may want to join in the greatest adventure that the human mind has ever begun." Richard P. Feynman in the Epilogue to the Feynman Lectures on Physics 1 PHYSICS It is a remarkable fact that all the phenomena we see around us, whether it is the red colour of the sunset or the light coming from the beginning of the universe, reflect the functioning of certain laws of nature. Physics is a human attempt to discover these laws and to study their consequences. What drives a physicist is the curiosity about nature and the fact that the answers to the various questions tie together in a beautiful pattern. It is also a fact that these attempts to understand the laws of nature have led to technological advances, and in turn these technological advances have provided physicist with new tools for understanding nature. This symbiosis of fundamental physics and technological advancements is one of the hall marks of our civilization. Aim of the Physics Undergraduate Program Research led undergraduate program in physics at SNU is designed for a student who either wishes to pursue a traditional/interdisciplinary research career in physics, or who wishes to use skills of a physicist to understand complex systems ranging from the earth's atmosphere to the human cell. The rigorous undergraduate program in physics, together with the multidisciplinary environment of SNU, will enable a student to engage creatively with problems that transcends the confines of any single discipline. The duration of B.Sc. (Research) in Physics is stipulated for 3 years (minimum) to 6 years (maximum). Learning Outcomes of the Physics Undergraduate Program • Students will demonstrate expertise in mathematical concept essential for practicing physics. • Students will demonstrate understanding of Electromagnetism, Classical mechanics, Thermal physics, Quantum mechanics, Statistical mechanics through problem solving, and will apply this knowledge to understand complex physical systems. • Students will exhibit experimental and computational skills acquired in laboratories through designing experiments, performing and analyzing the measurements to draw rational conclusions. • Students should be capable to demonstrate scientific writing, oral presentation skills, critical thinking and research methodology. 2 Highlights of the Physics Undergraduate Program Faculty The SNU Physics Department comprises of faculty members who are equally passionate about their research and teaching. They are keen to bring the excitement of discovery to the classroom and to involving students in their research. Their research interests ranges from nanotechnology to the beginning of the universe. Many of them have worked at some of the leading international research and academic institutions and continue to be involved in collaborative research with these institutions. Minor The department is committed to equipping students to meet the challenges that contemporary society faces in the area of energy, environment and economic development. Such training is facilitated by the possibility for a student to obtain a major in physics and minor in another discipline of his or her interest. For example, a student who has major in physics and a minor in economics would have very attractive job prospects in financial and banking industry. Similarly, a student interested in quantum computing, can major in physics and obtain minor in the mathematics. Laboratory The laboratory is an integral part of the physics program at SNU, not merely a supplement to the classroom teaching. It is the place for students to measure and explore the natural world. The salient feature of these programs is an innovative use of personal computers for data acquisition and analysis. Another important aspect is that labs will be project based and curiosity driven explorations, rather than simple repetition of standard experiments. Tutorial Program An essential part of learning physics is to apply abstract principles to concrete problems. With this in mind, most courses in physics will have an associated tutorial program. It is in the tutorial classes where the students will hone their skills as physicists, learning to make models, making crude estimates, and then solving the problem analytically or on a computer. It is also here that they will learn the skills of collaborative research. Undergraduate Thesis The goal of the physics program at SNU is to equip the students with skills to explore the unknown. The final year students will undertake a year-long research project which will lead to their undergraduate thesis. The thesis will be supervised by one of the faculty member and will address a research problem. 3 Major in Physics The coursework for a student majoring in physics has three broad parts. The first part, which covers the initial two academic years, is focused on developing a firm foundation of the subject. In the second part, which is the third academic year, student learns about more advance theoretical and experimental tools, often revisiting the concepts developed in the foundation part but viewing them using these sophisticated tools. At the end of the 4th semester the student will be able to appreciate and explore open research problems in physics, therefore in the final year the student will take electives from a wide range of courses, often related to the research interests of the faculty, and will start research work for his or her undergraduate thesis. Apart from the physics course, a physics major student is expected to take a broad-range of courses from natural sciences, engineering, humanities and social sciences. These courses fall in the following categories: University wide electives (UWE), Core common curriculum (CCC), Research, experiential and applied learning (REAL), Values, ethics, leadership and service (VELS). The Physics undergraduate advisor will assist all the students meeting the various departmental and university requirements. Credit Requirements for Physics Major Core Courses: Within the duration of UG program, a student is expected to complete 109 credits of core courses out of which 12 credits are expected to be achieved through physics elective courses. UWE: Within the duration of UG program, a student is expected to complete a minimum of 18 credits of UWE offered by other departments of science, engineering, and humanities. CCC: Within the duration of UG program, a student is expected to complete a minimum of 18 credits of CCC courses offered by all the departments of science, engineering, and humanities. However, the sum of CCC and UWE must be 42 credits. REAL: Within the duration of UG program, a student is expected to complete 25 credits from courses having research and experimental learning components. VELS: Within the duration of UG program, a student should complete 18 credits for VELS components. 4 An example of a flexible course organization for B.Sc.

SHIV NADAR UNIVERSITY Policy against Sexual Harassment CIRCULAR 21 July 2012 The Supreme Court of India, in a landmark judgment on 13 August 1997 (Vishaka & others vs. the State of Rajasthan & others) stated that every instance of sexual harassment is a violation of “Fundamental Rights” under Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution of India, and amounts to a violation of the “Right to Freedom” under Article 19 (1)(g). A second Supreme Court Judgment on 20 January 1999 (Apparel Export Promotion Council vs. A.K. Chopra) stated that sexually harassing behavior “needs to be eliminated as there is no compromise on such violations”. The Supreme Court further reiterated that sexual harassment “is a violation of the fundamental right to gender equality and the right to life and liberty”. Following the Supreme Court guidelines on the prevention and deterrence of sexual harassment in the workplace, the University has adopted a Policy against Sexual Harassment for the University. The said Policy is hereby announced. Shiv Nadar University is committed to providing a place of work and study free of sexual harassment, intimidation or exploitation. It is expected that all students, faculty and staff will treat one another and visitors to the University with respect. All members of the University community, including those who are in temporary or short-term positions, are subject to this policy. Anyone violating this policy is subject to disciplinary action. The interpretation of the term “workplace” for the purpose of the Policy will extend to all public spheres that remain in contact with members of the University community. Such public spaces include not just the physical premises under the supervision of the University system, but even areas where University members reside or travel to as part of their work as members of the University. The jurisdiction will include field trips, sports tournaments, conferences, festivals and all other activities undertaken by any person as a member of the University. Reports of sexual harassment are taken seriously and will be dealt with promptly by a designated Committee on Sensitization of Gender, Prevention and Redressal of Sexual Harassment. The specific action taken in any particular case will depend on the nature and gravity of the conduct reported. The University will respect the confidentiality and privacy of individuals reporting or accused of sexual harassment to the extent reasonably possible. Reprisals against an individual who in good faith reports, or provides information in an investigation, about behavior that may violate this Policy, are against the law and will not be tolerated. Intentionally providing false information, however, is grounds for disciplinary action. The emphasis of the Policy is on gender sensitization, and equitable, accountable and representative process of resolution and redressal in case of sexual harassment complaints, and it strives to prevent a division of men and women into two opposing interest groups. The University is committed to the principles of free inquiry and free expression. Vigorous discussion and debate are fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge, and this Policy is not intended to stifle teaching methods or freedom of expression. Sexual harassment, however, is never an exercise of academic freedom or freedom of expression. It compromises the 1 integrity of the University and its traditions of intellectual freedom, and it also violates the principle of equality and dignity of all its members. What is Sexual Harassment? Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual harassment when it is implicitly or explicitly suggested that submission to or rejection of the conduct will be a factor in academic or employment decisions or evaluations, or permission to participate in a University activity, or when the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s academic or work performance or creating an intimidating or hostile academic work or living environment on the basis of a person’s gender identity/sexual orientation. Determining what constitutes sexual harassment depends upon the specific facts and the context in which the conduct occurs. Sexual harassment may take many forms – subtle and indirect, or blatant and overt. For example, • It may be conduct towards an individual of the opposite sex or the same sex. • It may occur between peers or between individuals in a hierarchical relationship. • It may be aimed at coercing an individual to participate in an unwanted sexual relationship or it may have the effect of causing an individual to change behavior or work performance. • It may consist of repeated actions or may even arise from a single incident. What to do if you feel you are being sexually harassed Know your rights – Sexual harassment is illegal, both the law of the land and SNU prohibit sexual harassment. Speak up – If you can, tell the person to stop. State clearly and firmly that you want a particular behavior to cease. Get information and support – If you feel you cannot speak up, ask your friends to help you and bring it to the notice of the University. Keep records that might be useful for pursuing the case. What not to do Do not blame yourself. Sexual harassment is not something one brings on oneself. It is not a consequence of certain ways of dressing or acting. It is a violation of an individual’s right to work and live with dignity. Do not ignore it. Ignoring sexual harassment does not make it go away. The harasser may misinterpret a lack of response as approval of the behavior. Do not delay. Delay in action increases the probability that unwanted behavior will continue or escalate. Do not hesitate to ask for help. Speaking up may prevent others from being harmed as well. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2

Preamble In recent times, there has been a noticeable rise in the incidence of the use of banned and prohibited substances by students. Besides being harmful, ingestion of these substances reduces inhibitions, increases risky behaviour, and often results in situations that put the health and safety of students, both the user and others, in serious jeopardy. Consequently, the possession, consumption or distribution of alcohol, or any substance that can induce an altered state of mind and behaviour in a person, is prohibited at Shiv Nadar IoE (hereinafter referred to as the University). In addition, possession, distribution and use of cigarettes and tobacco are also banned for the health and well-being of all on the campus. 2. Scope of the Policy This Policy is aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of the University community, specifically by checking and deterring the use of alcohol and banned substances. It will be applicable to students, as well as to visitors, guests, and vendors entering the University for any reason. The Policy envisages active measures to detect the possession, consumption or distribution of alcohol and banned substances, including the use of Breathalyzers, as, when, and wherever required. All individuals entering the campus will be deemed to consent to the measures outlined in this Policy, as well as to searches and tests, by virtue of their wishing to enter the University premises. 3. Legal and Ethical Considerations The legal minimum age for consumption of alcohol in the state of Uttar Pradesh is 21 years. The University is committed to ensuring compliance with state laws and regulations regarding alcohol consumption and testing. 4 Policy for Prohibition of Consumption, Possession and Distribution of Banned and Prohibited Substances on the Campus I V1 4. Training Security personnel and any faculty/staff responsible for administering the breath analyser tests or conducting spot checks and searches, will be trained in the proper use of the equipment and in dealing with individuals in a respectful and non-confrontational manner. The process is non-invasive and respectful of individuals' rights and privacy and is used to determine inebriation. ENFORCEMENT OF POLICY 5. Testing Procedure Breath analyser tests will be conducted by trained Security personnel at the designated gates (No.1 and 2) of the University, or elsewhere on campus, as deemed necessary. The testing may be random or based on specific inputs regarding the use of alcohol by a certain individual(s), or for larger numbers, as deemed necessary to enforce this Policy. Any individual showing signs of inebriation will mandatorily be tested and further sent to the Health Centre. The Security personnel or staff/faculty deputed for the purpose are deemed to be competent to decide as to which individual is to be tested. Refusal to undergo the test by any individual will be deemed as evidence of their having consumed a banned substance and will dealt with as such. 6. Inebriation For the purposes of this policy, inebriation will be determined based upon the following, as assessed by the security staff or deputed personnel: -  Inability to walk steadily or conduct oneself reasonably. This may be tested by requiring an individual to walk along a straight line, if deemed necessary by the security staff, in addition to administering the Breathalyzer test. 5 Policy for Prohibition of Consumption, Possession and Distribution of Banned and Prohibited Substances on the Campus I V1  Observable signs of alcohol consumption include but are not limited to, walking unsteadily, a strong smell of alcohol, slurring of speech, non-cooperation, loud and brash conduct, and physical or verbal aggression or violent behavior.  All Students, Staff and Faculty are obliged to immediately report to Security any individual noticed or found to be intoxicated or inebriated on campus, and to extend help on the spot so that the said person can be sent to the Health Care Facility expeditiously. 7. Threshold In accordance with Section 185 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the permissible limit for Blood Alcohol Concentration BAC of 30 mg%, is established for breath analyser tests. While this threshold is specified in the context of the ability to drive a vehicle safely, it indicates the level at which a person’s responses and judgement are likely to be affected adversely on account of imbibing alcohol. 8. Prohibited Substances Any student found using, distributing or in possession of any Prohibited Substance will, in addition to the provisions of this Policy, also attract prosecution under the relevant laws. Such students may be suspended or expelled from the University. 9. Actions on Detection If the Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of an individual is found to exceed 30 mg% threshold, their particulars will be recorded and passed on to the Office of the Dean of Students for further action, which may include disciplinary measures as per University policy. In case a student is assessed to be in a condition warranting medical attention, they will be directed, or taken, to the Health Centre for appropriate medical attention and management. In addition, Campus Security, Hostel Staff, Law Enforcement and Parents may also be notified by the University, depending upon the assessed need to do so in each case. 6 Policy for Prohibition of Consumption, Possession and Distribution of Banned and Prohibited Substances on the Campus I V1 10. Any Vendor staff, guest or visitor found to have consumed alcohol, or any banned substance will not be permitted entry to the campus. In the case of Vendor staff, this may also result in a permanent ban on entry of the individual as well as consequences to the Vendor. 11. Persons enforcing the Policy are acting on behalf of the University and are vested with the authority to do so. They will be firm and unambiguous, yet correct and non- confrontational in their dealing with the students or any other person wishing to enter the campus. Students entering into an altercation with the staff over perceived infringement or any other grounds related to the performance of his/her mandated duty, in so far as this policy is concerned, will be grounds for strict disciplinary action as well. 12. Upon receiving a BAC report from the Security Staff of a student exceeding 30 mg% of thresholds, the following course of action will be taken by the Student Disciplinary Committee (SDC); A. In case the student admits to consuming alcohol, and if it is a first offence of this nature: a. A warning letter. b. One-month suspension of their gate pass and c. Notification to Parents d. Mandatory attendance for Sports Mentoring Program (SMP) for a specified period. B. In case of contestation, wherein a student denies the allegations, they will face the SDC. C. In case a student is found to be in a highly inebriated state, is unconscious, or indulging in aggressive or violent behavior, they will be liable for stricter disciplinary action, even if it is the first offence and the student later admits to it. In such cases, 7 Policy for Prohibition of Consumption, Possession and Distribution of Banned and Prohibited Substances on the Campus I V1 Student Disciplinary Proceedings will be initiated that may include, but are not limited to: a. A Financial penalty of upto Rs. 50,000/- b. A written undertaking of good conduct in future, from the student and parent. c. Suspension of at least one Semester from the University D. Any Student found aiding or abetting the offenders to escape detection or disciplinary consequences will also be liable for disciplinary action, as determined by the competent authority. 13. Support and Resources Any individual struggling with alcohol-related issues, who seeks help will be offered support and counselling to the extent possible, utilising the facilities and resources available with the University Health Care. Merely seeking help for alcohol dependency will not be viewed as ground for disciplinary action. 14. Review The Office of the Dean of Students will periodically review the effectiveness of the policy and may make changes and adjustments based on experience of its implementation, feedback and changing circumstances. It will also update the policy as needed to address changing legal requirements, technological advancements, and campus needs. 8

Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University) Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students Any activity conducted willfully or unknowingly, can be considered as Academic Malpractice if that activity results in the loss of integrity of the processes of teaching, learning and research. Academic Malpractice includes, but is not restricted to, the following activities: a) Plagiarism. b) Cheating, or helping to cheat, in assignments, laboratories, and exams. c) Colluding to achieve a grade which you are not entitled to from your own efforts. d) Not following instructions as given in the University Exam Answer Sheet. e) Fabrication or falsification of data, results and outputs in coursework. f) Tampering with answer sheets of exams, checked assignments and reports. g) Misrepresentation of facts on resumes. The university’s process for handling academic misconduct has the following goals:  Giving individual faculty members a say in dealing with cases in their courses, and an opportunity to counsel and correct their students.  Ensuring every case is centrally recorded so that repeat violators are detected and treated accordingly.  Protecting the student’s rights while the hearings are being conducted. This policy is intended only for cases of academic misconduct, and does not apply to other types of indiscipline such as violation of hostel rules. Any kind of Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism, examination indiscipline will be dealt by a sub-committee called ‘Examination Disciplinary Committee’ constituted by the Examination Committee. A. Examinations Disciplinary Committee (EDC) and its Procedures The EDC initiates action regarding academic misconduct when it receives the Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct or the Form for Reporting Academic Misconduct from a faculty or staff member. The Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct can be filed when a student has accepted a misconduct within a course and the penalty proposed by the course instructor or coordinator. The penalty can range from a marks deduction to an F grade in the course. The Form for Reporting Academic Misconduct can be filed by a faculty or staff member to bring a case directly to the EDC. 1) When a Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct is received, the EDC checks whether the concerned student has been previously found guilty of a violation, or whether there is a previous filing of the Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct for that student. If not, the filed form is recorded but no further action is taken. If there is a record of a previous violation, the EDC conducts a hearing within 10 teaching days. Notices are sent to the accused student and the course instructor. ___________________________________________________________________________ Shiv Nadar IOE_ Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University) Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students 2) When a Form for Reporting Academic Misconduct is received, the EDC conducts a hearing within 10 teaching days. Notices are sent to the accused student and the accusing party. 3) It is the instructor’s choice whether to meet the student and offer to work out an in- course penalty, or to send the case directly to the EDC. 4) If the student signs the Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct, his or her acceptance of the misconduct and the penalty will be taken as final and no further appeal will be possible. 5) When members of the EDC are themselves party to a case, they may not participate in any way in the hearing process related to it. 6) In case the student is an undergraduate, the student’s Undergraduate Advisor shall be invited to the hearing as a non-voting observer. If necessary, the Undergraduate Advisor may nominate another faculty member of the Department Undergraduate Committee to attend in his or her place. 7) In case the student is a graduate student, the student’s Graduate Advisor shall be invited to the hearing as a non-voting observer. If necessary, the Graduate Advisor may nominate another faculty member of the Department Graduate Committee to attend in his or her place. 8) When two or more students are involved in the same case of alleged academic misconduct, the EDC may deal with the case against the whole group at a single hearing. 9) Both parties shall have an opportunity to present their cases during the hearing, and to examine the evidence. 10) The Chair of the EDC may summon any witness to the event under the scrutiny of the EDC. 11) The decision of the EDC shall be announced within 3 teaching days of the hearing. A notice of the decision shall be sent to the student. 12) The student may appeal the decision of the EDC to the Vice Chancellor within 10 days of the announcement of the decision. The decision of the Vice Chancellor is final and binding on all concerned, and there can be no further appeal or review. 13) Once the appeal process is complete, the outcome is announced by the Vice Chancellor, notices are sent to the student, the accusing party, and the Head of the department in which the student is enrolled. 14) The Office of the Controller of Examinations maintains the records of the actions taken by the EDC, including minutes of meetings and notices of judgements. 15) A student who has been found guilty of a violation in a course may not withdraw from that course. A student who withdraws prior to the final judgement may still become liable for penalties including an F in that course. ___________________________________________________________________________ Shiv Nadar IOE_ Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University) Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students B. Instructions for Faculty 1) A student suspected of cheating in an exam should be allowed to complete the exam, but the evidence should be collected. In a written exam, the answer book should be confiscated and a fresh one issued. 2) In a case of cheating or plagiarism in a course, the instructor may impose a penalty within the course that can range from a marks deduction to an F grade in the course. If the student accepts the misconduct and the penalty, the event should be reported to the Office of the Controller of Examinations using the Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct. 3) The instructor may also elect not to discuss the matter directly with the student, or the student may not accept the penalty suggested by the instructor. In either case, the event should be reported to the Office of the Controller of Examinations using the Form for Reporting Academic Misconduct. 4) The instructor may consult with the Office of the Controller of Examinations while taking the above steps. 5) All cases of cheating in a final exam (or its equivalent) must be reported to the Office of the Controller of Examinations and should not be disposed of by the instructor. 6) The filing of the Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct or the Form for Reporting Academic Misconduct, should occur within 5 teaching days (excluding Saturdays) of the detection of the misconduct. 7) The student may appeal the decision of the EDC. In the event of such an appeal, the action recommended will be kept on hold. 8) Until the final decision is announced, the student’s participation in the course should not be restricted nor any marks penalized. 9) In case of a repeat violation, the EDC may take up the case even if a Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct has been filed and may increase the penalty. 10) If the EDC does not convey its decision before the grade submission deadline, the complete records of the student’s performance in the course should be submitted, and the R (‘Result Withheld’) grade allotted. This will be converted to a standard grade once the EDC announces a final judgement. C. Sanctions The sanctions imposed by an instructor must be confined to the concerned course. They include but are not confined to resubmission of work, retest, reduced marks on an evaluation component, reduced grade for the course, and an F grade for the course. The EDC may impose any sanction from reduced marks to expulsion from the university. Other possible sanctions include, but are not restricted to, an F grade in a course, loss of financial aid, probation or suspension, or a combination of these. ___________________________________________________________________________ Shiv Nadar IOE_ Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University) Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students A penalty of probation or suspension must specify starting and ending dates. In case of copied work, the copier and the provider are equally culpable. The minimum sanction for cheating in a final exam (or equivalent) is an F grade in the course. D. Department and Instructor Policy Each Department or Centre may formulate its own policy that supplements the University Policy. The goals of this policy may include: 1) Providing guidelines for faculty on penalties commensurate with the student’s misconduct, for cases where a Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct form is filed. 2) Expanding and clarifying the definitions of academic malpractice and plagiarism within the context of the department’s practice. The department policy should be submitted to the Deans of Studies, and should be widely publicized among students taking courses in the department. The instructor of a course may also announce a course-specific policy on academic malpractice and plagiarism. This policy should be part of the course description distributed to students at the start of the course. In case of any conflict, the University Policy will take precedence over the Department or Instructor Policy. ___________________________________________________________________________ Shiv Nadar IOE_ Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism Shiv Nadar (Institution of Eminence Deemed to be University) Policy on Academic Malpractice and Plagiarism for Students Form for Faculty Disposition of Academic Misconduct (Not to be used for violations in the End Semester Examination) For Faculty: Submit this form to the Office of the Controller of Examinations within 5 teaching days (excluding Saturdays) of the detection of the misconduct if you have resolved the matter with the student, and the student has accepted the misconduct as well as the penalty proposed by you.

BACKGROUND Shiv Nadar University (SNU) offers attractive scholarships in the form of tuition fee waivers to meritorious students. The waivers are starting from 100% fee waivers, to partial waivers. These tuition fee waivers are applicable for the 8 semesters of the undergraduate and PhD programs and 4 semesters of the Master’s program. 2. SCOPE The term Scholarship is used to depict fee waivers. Retention of Tuition Fee Waiver Policy deals with the tuition fee waivers only. The tuition fee waiver relates to the 8 semesters of study for a four year undergraduate degree program, 4 semesters of study for a two year Master’s degree program and 8 semesters of study for a PhD program. This policy doesn’t define the entitlements attached to various scholarship types and their respective eligibility criteria, these criteria are defined separately through admission notifications for each academic year. The student must make all other payments that are due, including Admission Fee, Hostel Fee, and Security Deposit etc. These payments are not covered under Retention of Tuition Fee Waiver Policy. The charges for summer semester cannot be waived as they fall outside the scope of this policy. The conditions for retaining the tuition fee waiver are made explicit and published on the website before the start of respective admission process every year.

UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The scholarship band of a student will change depending on the following criteria 3.1. CGPA CRITERIA 3.1.1 Admission Year 2018: To encourage students to continuously perform better for all four years of their study in SNU, a merit based scholarship system is being introduced from the UG batch of 2018. The scholarship offered at the time of admissions holds god for their first year. The Scholarship award from 2nd year onwards will be based on student’s academic performance in the preceding academic year. So, the Scholarship Band for the 2nd year is determined by the Academic Performance of first year, i.e. CGPA at the end of 2nd semester (after consideration of summer semester, if any).Likewise, the Scholarship Bands for 3rd and 4th Years are determined by the CGPA attained at the end of 4th and 6th semesters (after consideration of summer semester, if any). There is no Scholarship offered beyond 8th semester.The minimum CGPA to get any scholarship band is 6.50. Below 6.50 CGPA, a student will lose tuition fee waiver for the next full academic year. There is no retrospective restoration or upgradation of scholarship.

The students who 11 Retention of Tuition Fee Waiver ST202 V1.3 opt for deferred payment plan will have to apply to the Dean Student Welfare giving proof of family income along with an undertaking signed by the parent or guardian giving acceptance of deferred payment plan. The application should be submitted along with the demand draft for the first instalment of fee. All requests for deferred payment will be approved by the President based on recommendation by the Dean Student Welfare. The deferred payment plan is valid only for a semester and must be applied for again in every semester that the plan is requested. 8. LATE FEES A late payment fee of ₹100/- per calendar day will be charged for every day of delay in payment of fees beyond the due date. For deferred payment plan, levying of late fee will be applicable from the due date of each instalment. The late fee is separate for each instalment, i.e. if at any stage if there are two instalments that are delayed, the late fee will be ₹100/- per day for the 1st delayed instalment, and will become ₹100/- + ₹100/- or ₹200/- per day when the next instalment also comes into default. A delay of beyond 30 calendar days in payment of fees can lead to suspension of the students for the rest of the semester or any other punitive action deemed fit by the Dean Student Welfare. 9. FAILURE TO PAY FEES Failure to pay fee can lead to cancelation of registration of the student, debarring her from appearing in the final examinations, withholding results or any other punitive action that University Authorities may deem appropriate including expulsion from the University.

This philosophy offers students the freedom to explore a variety of subjects and areas of interest. Such room for exploration and discovery is aimed at providing students the opportunity to pursue a range of intellectual interests resulting in greater academic success, better career choices and deeper personal satisfaction.

Minor in Chemistry Chemistry forms the link between the fundamental principles governing the nature of the universe and the science of life. Chemistry education at SNU provides focus on a variety of inter-disciplinary areas, spanning different scientific disciplines, e.g. Materials Science, Bioinformatics, Environmental Sciences, or Chemical Biology, as well as non-traditional areas in the arts and humanities. A Chemistry Minor provides a broad background in chemical principles, that can serve as a stepping stone to further in-depth study in related areas that build upon this background. The Chemistry Minor curriculum at SNU is divided into two stages: introductory general chemistry, and foundation courses providing breadth across sub-disciplines. Since chemistry is an experimental science, substantial laboratory work is an integral part of almost all our Chemistry courses. Introductory or General Chemistry: The introductory general chemistry courses provide a common grounding in basic chemical concepts for students with diverse backgrounds, develop basic mathematical and laboratory skills, and prepare students for the foundation courses, allowing for a period for consolidation of chemical concepts, mathematical and laboratory skills. For students pursuing a Chemistry Minor, the introductory chemistry courses provide preparation for the foundation course work, ensuring that students know basic chemical concepts such as stoichiometry, states of matter, atomic structure, molecular structure and bonding, thermodynamics, equilibria, and kinetics. Students also need to be competent in basic laboratory skills such as safe practices, keeping a notebook, use of electronic balances and volumetric glassware, preparation of solutions, chemical measurements using pH. Foundation Courses: Foundation courses provide breadth and lay the groundwork for more in-depth course work. Elective in-depth courses in areas of the student’s interests build upon these foundations and develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Laboratory Experience: The chemistry laboratory experience at SNU includes synthesis of molecules; measurement of chemical properties, structures, and phenomena; hands-on experience with modern analytical instrumentation; and computational data analysis and modelling. All laboratory programs are conducted in a safe environment that includes adherence to national and state regulations regarding hazardous waste management and laboratory safety, including facilities for chemical waste disposal, safety information and reference materials, and personal protective equipment available to all students and faculty. The chemistry laboratories at SNU are equipped with functioning fume hoods, safety showers, eyewashes, first aid kits, and readily available fire extinguishers. Students are trained in modern chemical safety, to understand responsible disposal techniques, understand and comply with safety regulations, understand and use material safety data sheets (MSDS), recognize and minimize potential chemical and physical hazards in the laboratory, and know how to handle laboratory emergencies effectively. Problem-Solving Skills: As part of the SNU experience, students will be expected to develop the ability to define problems, develop testable hypotheses, design and execute experiments, analyze data using statistical methods, and draw appropriate conclusions. The Chemistry Minor curriculum provides ample opportunities for developing both written and oral communication skills, as well as team skills. Our instructional programs incorporate team experiences in classroom and laboratory components of the chemistry curriculum. Students at SNU may earn a Minor in Chemistry upon successfully completing the following courses: Course Code Course Name Credits (L:T:P) CHY101/CHY111 Applied Chemistry/Chemical Principles 3:1:1 CHY112 Structure and Bonding 3:1:1 CHY211 Chemical Equilibrium 3:1:1 CHY213 Chemical Analysis lab 1:0:1 CHY221 Organic Reactions & Mechanisms 3:0:1 Plus one elective from:  CHY242: Coordination Chemistry (4 credits)  CHY244: The Nature of Materials (3 credits)  CHY344: Topics in Nanotechnology (3 credits)  CHY252: Biochemistry (4 credits)  CHY351: Macromolecules (3 credits) Courses from among the above list taken as part of a student’s non-Chemistry Major requirement also count towards the Minor in Chemistry. 5.

Minor in Dance DESCRIPTION The Undergraduate Program in Dance Studies integrates physical and intellectual endeavor to engender knowledge of the self, culture and meaning as manifested in movement. Students grapple with issues such as embodiment, pleasure, meaning; with structural features governing the movement of human bodies in space and time; and with historical, cultural and sociological aspects of dance, such as ritual, patronage, caste, and sexuality. Dance is situated within the broader intellectual, political and artistic movements of the nineteenth, twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The Minor in Dance, open to all students at SNU, is ideally suited to students with some dance training who seek to advance physical skills while bringing intellectual rigor to their field of study. The program can also accommodate students without prior dance training who want to explore dance as part of a vibrant liberal arts curriculum. The Minor in Dance prepares the student for a graduate program in Dance, Performance Studies, or Education with a view to research, performance or teaching. STRUCTURE AND REQUIREMENTS To complete a Minor in Dance students must take a minimum of 19 credits. The break up is as follows. The following course is mandatory (3 credits): Dance and National Identity They must choose two of the following courses (3 credits): a) Writing Bodies b) Pedagogy c) Body, Performance, Gesture And two of the following (5 credits) a) The Dancer's Body b) Movement and Meaning c) Odissi Paddhiti I d) Odissi Paddhiti II e) Bodies, Spaces and Places 9.

Minor in Design Objective: In the background of rapidly changing global economy Industrial Design is playing positive role. By introducing Design Minor at SNU for the undergraduate the university will provide excellent opportunity in wider range of placement for the undergraduate students. Design being an interdisciplinary discipline it provides much broader vision and professional exposure. No Indian Universities provides such opportunity to the undergraduate students unless they take admission in the Design Department/ Design Schools. The Design Minor at SNU would allow the students to remain in their respective major branch while simultaneously acquiring professional knowledge in an applied field that would help them with alternative opportunity in placement. Design Minor (Industrial Design) proposes to offer a set of following five foundation courses- 1. DES101: Elements and Principles of Design, 4 credits (2-0-2) 2. DES121: Introduction to Visual Communication Design, 4 credits (2-0-2) 3. DES111: Introduction to Product Design, 4 credits (2-0-2) 4. DES131: Introduction to Ergonomics, 4 credits (2-0-2) 5. DES201: Color in Design, 4 credits (2-0-2) 11. Minor in Economics Students wishing to take courses in intermediate/advanced courses in Economics will have to demonstrate suitable preparation in aspects of mathematics (including calculus, algebra and statistics). The department requires the students to complete six courses successfully to earn a minor degree in Economics. The course structure is as follows:  ECO 101 Principles of Microeconomics (O) (4 credits)  ECO 102 Principles of Macroeconomics (E) (4 credits)  ECO 301 Intermediate Microeconomics (O) (4 credits)  ECO 221 Introductory Econometrics (E) (4 credits)  ECO XXX Elective (3 credits)  ECO XXX Elective (3 credits) The courses marked with an (O) will typically be offered in odd semesters whereas those marked with an (E) will typically be offered in even semesters. Electives can be chosen from amongst the courses being offered by the department in any given semester. However only 2nd or higher level courses can be taken as electives. Intermediate and advanced courses may have pre-requisites and the students should ensure that they satisfy these before taking a course. The students do not have to take the courses in the above order. They can complete a course as long as they satisfy the pre-requisites for that course. For example, ECO 232 can be completed before ECO 301. (Please check with the course instructor to see if you satisfy the pre-requisites for the course). Students should ensure that they can fit the courses in their time table. Unfortunately the department cannot entertain requests to adjust the time table to suit individual students. There is no registration for obtaining a minor in Economics. Students interested in completing a minor are advised to register in ECO 101 and then ECO 102. They can then progress to completing the other requirements. Given the structure of the program, students are strongly advised to register in ECO 101 no later than their third semester at SNU. After finishing all the six courses required for a minor, the students may hand in a written application to the department (the form may be obtained from the department’s Undergraduate Advisor). These names will then be forwarded to the Dean's office for award of a minor in Economics. 12. Minor in Electrical Engineering FOR CIVIL ENGG. AND MECH ENGG. MAJORS: FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGG.

Minor in Mathematics Undergraduate students of the university who are not majoring in Mathematics have the option to take a Minor in Mathematics. A Minor in Mathematics can serve two distinct functions (apart from enjoying the beauty of the subject!): 1. Acquiring the academic background for higher studies in mathematics. 2. Acquiring modelling and computational skills for applications of mathematics in other disciplines or in industry. Academic Requirements: You have to acquire a minimum of 18 credits as University Wide Electives (UWE) from the courses offered by the Department of Mathematics. These credits must satisfy the following minimum requirements: 1. At least 8 credits from the following: MAT 101 (Calculus I), MAT 102 (Calculus II), MAT 220 (Real Analysis I), MAT 240 (Algebra I), MAT 260 (Linear Algebra I), MAT 280 (Numerical Analysis I), MAT 284 (Probability) 2. At least 8 credits from MAT courses numbered 300 or above. 3. A course cannot count towards both Major and Minor requirements. For example, B.Tech. students cannot count MAT 201 towards the Minor because it is a compulsory course in their Major. 4. Certain course combinations are not allowed. If you have already credited a course with significant overlap with a certain MAT course, or a more advanced course than the MAT course, you may not earn credit for the Minor from that MAT course. A list of such banned combinations will be published before each semester’s course registration. The Undergraduate Advisor for Mathematics will help you work out an appropriate choice of courses depending on your interests and background. How to Apply and Select Courses: 1. You have to register for the Minor – the first step is to obtain permission from the UG Advisor of the Department of Mathematics. 2. You will select courses for the Minor in consultation with the UG Advisor for Mathematics. 3. You must sign up for the Minor before the deadline announced by the university. However, it is advisable to do so earlier so that there is sufficient time to plan your courses. 4. Please note that you must register for the Minor as described here. It is not enough to merely take adequate credits on your own. Registration is also subject to availability of slots. 5. If you fail to complete the Minor during your regular tenure at SNU, you may have to spend an extra semester to complete it. If you do so, any scholarship or fee waiver you were granted for your regular course of study will lapse and you will have to pay the full fees for the extra period. 18.
